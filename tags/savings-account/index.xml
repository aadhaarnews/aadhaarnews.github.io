      <title>India&#39;s Call Drop Problem: No More Tricks, Telecom Minister Warns Operators</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Telecom Minister Manoj Sinha today said his ministry is keeping a watchful eye on all factors of call drop measurement&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Refusing to lower his guard on the issue of call drops, Telecom Minister Manoj Sinha today said his ministry is keeping a watchful eye on all factors of call drop measurement, which leaves no room for any manipulation. &amp;ldquo;We are looking at every aspect of call drop. No trick will work in this case,&amp;rdquo; Sinha told Press Trust of India in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recent report from the Department of Telecom (DoT) had said call drops had come down by seven per cent in three months between December 2016 to March 2017. The minister was responding to a query on whether the DoT has taken into account the prolonged use of &amp;lsquo;radio link timeout&amp;rsquo;, a technology that prevents disconnection of calls even if there is no or weak signal. Usually, in such cases, the customer ends up disconnecting the call without it showing up as a call drop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Not only the DoT report, but even Trai releases official report every quarter&amp;hellip; they clearly show that there is a significant reduction in call drop. However, it is a matter of continuous monitoring. Also, the manner in which BTS (Base Transceiver Stations) have been installed in last 8-9 months is a record,&amp;rdquo; Sinha noted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The telecom operators had informed the government that they installed more than 1.60 lakh additional BTS or mobile sites across the country between June 15 and December 31, 2016 and another 1.1 lakh additional mobile sites were committed by March 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As per a report of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India, all operators have met call drop standard norms in the three months ended June and September. In October-December 2016, Trai found performance of Aircel below par for call drops in most circles. The DoT has set up an IVRS or automated call system which makes random calls to subscribers to check status of call drops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sinha said the IVRS is helping the government in identifying blind spots in areas that do not receive mobile signals or get weak ones. &amp;ldquo;The IVRS system makes an average 2600-2700 calls everyday. It is helping us in identifying those blind spots where there are regular call drops and telecom service providers are informed about it. They (telecom operators) are trying to sort it out,&amp;rdquo; Sinha added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The minister emphasised that the government is boosting telecom connectivity across the country, including optical fibre rollout in village panchayats, the North-East and even in Left wing extremism-affected areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We have been successful in connecting 91,000 panchayats. In coming 15-20 days, we will meet our target of connecting one lakh panchayats. There was problem of equipment. It was an indigenous technology developed by (state-owned company) C-DOT. Vendors were not available. It took a lot of time in testing,&amp;rdquo; Sinha said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, 50 thousand such equipment have been supplied by Tejas Networks, ITI Ltd and L&amp;amp;T.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I feel that from next week onwards (optical fibre) in as many as 300 villages per day will be lit. Thereafter, the pace will increase to 400 villages per day. Right now, it is around 100 villages,&amp;rdquo; Sinha said.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ICICI, Axis, SBI Gain, RBI To Get Power To Act Against Loan Defaulters</title>
      <link>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/icici-axis-sbi-gain-rbi-to-get-power-to-act-against-loan-defaulters/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Union Cabinet cleared an ordinance empowering the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to act against wilful defaulters. The ordinance has been sent to the president for approval. The ordinance is aimed at empowering RBI to deal more effectively with stressed assets than earlier. A senior finance ministry official said &amp;ldquo;It is part of a broader plan to resolve bad loans with banks&amp;rsquo; issue that has been a major hurdle in the economy from achieving its full potential.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Banking sub-index on the NSE Nifty Bank index rose to its record high following this development. The index advanced as much as 2 per cent to hit record high of 22,743.70. Sub-index of the public-sector banks Nifty PSU index also rallied over 3 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ordinance may enable RBI to direct banks on how to deal with stressed assets. Moving an amendment to the banking regulation act may take time as the next session of parliament starts sometime after second week of July.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The amended law will also empower RBI to set up oversight panels that will shield bankers from later action by probe agencies looking into loan recasts as a lot of discretion will be involved in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By December 2016, non-performing assets (NPAs) or bad loans with Indian banks rose to Rs. 6.07 lakh crore, of which the share of Public sector banks was Rs. 5.02 lakh crore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysts say the ordinance is a positive step towards banks recovering their dues from the defaulters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kishor Ostwal of CNI Research, says &amp;ldquo;Because of this ordinance there will be more and more recovery of bad loans and wilful defaulters which have money will come out and repay their debts.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the individual banking shares, ICICI Bank was the top gainer, rose 9.18 per cent to Rs 297.8.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Canara Bank, Bank of Baroda, State Bank of India, IDFC Bank, Punjab National Bank and Axis Bank were also among the other gainer in the banking sun-index rising between 1-3.5 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the state-run lenders, Union Bank, Andhra Bank, IDBI Bank and  Allahabad Bank also rallied up to 4 per cent each.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The monthly average balance (MAB) requirement has been increased to as high as Rs 5,000 for branches in six metros.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;State Bank of India, the country&amp;rsquo;s biggest lender, has decided to increase manifold the minimum balance required for maintaining savings account from April 1, hitting 31 crore depositors including pensioners and students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The monthly average balance (MAB) requirement has been increased to as high as Rs 5,000 for branches in six metros.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Savings bank account holders of SBI and its five associates - which will merge with it on April 1 - will have to maintain the monthly balance or else they will invite a penalty ranging from Rs 20 (in rural branches) to Rs 100 (in metro cities).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;State Bank of India has 31 crore savings bank accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of now, the monthly average balance (MAB) for a savings bank account is Rs 500 without facility of cheque book and Rs 1,000 with cheque book across the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India&amp;rsquo;s largest bank has now decided to fix separate MABs for &amp;lsquo;metro&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;urban&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;semi-urban&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;rural&amp;rsquo; areas from the beginning of next financial year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The benchmark for MAB and penalties are likely to be followed by other public sector banks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The monthly average balance for metro branches will be Rs 5,000 and penalty for non-maintenance of minimum balance will be between Rs 50 and Rs 100. For urban and semi-urban branches, the monthly average balance has been fixed at Rs 3,000 and Rs 2,000, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case of rural branches, the minimum balance has been fixed at Rs 1,000. Breach of MAB will attract a penalty ranging between Rs 20 and Rs 50.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Five associates banks of SBI - State Bank of Bikaner and Jaipur (SBBJ), State Bank of Mysore (SBM), State Bank of Travancore (SBT), State Bank of Patiala (SBP) and State Bank of Hyderabad (SBH) - will merge with the parent on April 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the merger of all the five associates, SBI is expected to become a lender of global proportions with an asset base of Rs 37 lakh crore or over $555 billion, 22,500 branches and 58,000 ATMs. It will have over 50 crore customers.&lt;/p&gt;

      <link>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/119-banks-connected-aadhaar-enabled-payment-system-minister/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 24 May 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/119-banks-connected-aadhaar-enabled-payment-system-minister/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The government on Friday said 119 banks are connected with the Aadhaar-enabled payment system and 33.87 crore transactions have taken place through Aadhaar-enabled payment systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There are 111 crore Aadhaar enrolments done so far out of the total population of 125 crore in India. Aadhaar is becoming a powerful instrument to bridge the digital divide,” Ravi Shankar Prasad, Minister of Information Technology, said here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said ₹36,000 crore has been saved in the last two years due to the linking of Aadhaar with the public distribution system including household LPG supply and MGNREGA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prasad also said 4.47 crore bank accounts have been opened with Aadhaar eKYC as compared to only one lakh accounts opened as of May 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>GST To Lower Tax Burden On Medical Devices, Smartphones: Finance Ministry</title>
      <link>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/gst-to-lower-tax-burden-on-medical-devices-smartphones/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 24 May 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/gst-to-lower-tax-burden-on-medical-devices-smartphones/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Goods and Services Tax (GST) will lead to lower tax burden in several commodities, including packaged cement, medicaments, smartphones and medical devices, the Finance Ministry said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Packaged cement attracts central excise duty of 12.5 per cent plus Rs 125 PMT (per metric tonne) and standard VAT (value-added tax) rate of 14.5 per cent. At these rates, the present total tax incidence works out to more than 29 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If we include tax incidence on account of central sales tax (CST), octroi, entry tax, etc., the present total tax incidence would work out to more than 31 per cent. As against this, the proposed GST rate for cement is 28 per cent,&amp;rdquo; the ministry said here in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will be lesser tax burden in case of medicaments, including Ayurvedic, Unani, Siddha, Homeopathic or Bio-chemic systems also.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Medicaments, in general, attract six per cent central excise duty and five per cent VAT. Further, CST, octroi, entry tax, etc. are also applicable in general. At these rates, the present total tax incidence works out to more than 13 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As against this, the proposed GST rate on medicines, including ayurvedic medicines, is 12 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smartphone attracts two per cent central excise duty (one per cent excise duty + one per cent NCCD (national contingency and calamity duty). VAT rates vary from state to state from five to 15 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Weighted average VAT rate on smartphones works out to about 12 per cent. Thus, the present total tax incidence on smart phones works out to more than 13.5 per cent. As against this, the proposed GST rate for smartphones is 12 per cent,&amp;rdquo; the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, medical devices, including surgical instruments, in general attract six per cent central excise duty and five per cent VAT. Along with CST, octroi, entry tax, etc., the present total tax incidence on them works out to more than 13 per cent. As against this, the proposed rate under GST is 12 per cent, it said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worship materials including that required for &amp;lsquo;havan&amp;rsquo; will be under the nil category. However, exact formulation for the same is yet to be finalised.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;At an interactive awareness programme for start-ups, the experts said the government is expected to resolve the queries of entrepreneurs regarding GST.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GST will not only ease the process of taxation, but bring in transparency, say experts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At an interactive awareness programme for start-ups here, the experts said the government is expected to resolve the queries of entrepreneurs regarding GST.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;GST will not only ease the process, but also bring transparency as all the invoices needed to be uploaded by sellers are visible to the buyer every month,&amp;rdquo; said Manish Ojha, Development Head of KDK Softwares Pvt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CEO Mohit Bhambani said many startups are into e-commerce and their logistic costs go up, with 11 categories of taxes levied on the road transport sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Referring to a report of Crisil, Bhambani said GST can reduce logistics cost of companies producing non-bulk goods by as much as 20 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At present, he said various road permits are required under state CST rules and also declaration forms for availing of lower taxation rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Likewise, many such hassles will be removed for ease of business operations,&amp;rdquo; he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several startups attended the session organised by the city based incubation centre Startup Oasis and KDK softwares.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>India&#39;s Plan Of Affordable Housing For All By 2022</title>
      <link>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/how-gst-real-estate-act-will-boost-housing/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The government has backed its Housing for All by 2022 promise with a slew of reforms for buyers and developers alike.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Indian real estate sector has seen a resurgence of interest in 2017 after a slowdown over the past 2-3 years, buoyed by the affordable housing segment, which includes residential units below Rs 50 lakh. Legislations the like Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, (RERA) and Goods and Services Tax (GST) have signalled that the government is ready to walk the talk for its &amp;lsquo;Housing for All&amp;rsquo; by 2022 promise and many developers and institutional players have flocked to the affordable housing market, a report by Colliers International India, the Indian wing of a global commercial real estate company said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Most institutional players are looking at affordable housing as a &amp;lsquo;mid-margin and quick turnaround&amp;rsquo; product to ensure reasonable returns,&amp;rdquo; Gagan Randev, National Director, Capital Markets and Investment Services, Colliers International India said. This has been made possible with speedy government approvals and incentives to end-users (especially the first-time home buyers living in rented accommodations to motivate them to own their own dream home), he added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;here-are-some-of-the-key-highlights-on-india-s-push-for-affordable-housing&#34;&gt;Here are some of the key highlights on India&amp;rsquo;s push for affordable housing:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The long-awaited infrastructure status to the sector under the Finance Bill 2018, is expected to allow builders easy access to capital at economical rates, clearer investment guidelines and greater transparency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The government has tweaked the definition of affordable housing projects to pave the way for 100 per cent tax subsidy on profits of an affordable housing undertaking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arms of established players like Shappoorji Pallonji Joyville and Tata Value Homes, etc, which have rebranded themselves to cater to this mass and exciting segment, Colliers said, noting that it has also drawn institutions and funds like HDFC Capital, IFC, Standard Chartered, Kotak Investment Advisors etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The government has also addressed common grievances like the uncertainty of approvals taking too long, developers delaying possession with clearer investment guidelines and greater transparency under RERA.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The new reforms are also attracting new entrants to the market like Tribeca Developers and sovereign funds like ADIA, which have lined up substantial commitments to the real estate segment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apart from sops for the builders, the government has introduced a slew of benefits for home buyers such as allowing interest subsidy of 3-4 per cent for first time home buyers for loans up to Rs 12 lakhs and Rs 9 lakhs respectively under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many states have also introduced policies for affordable housing to buyers such as zero maintenance fees for five years and check on developers to ensure timely project completions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;According to a recent study by property portal PropTiger, the affordable housing segment continued to have a higher share in total residential sales and contributed over 50 per cent to the total sales in Q3 FY17 across top nine cities of India.&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Modi government is firming up a plan to create India&#39;s own Harvard</title>
      <link>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/hrd-ministry-seeks-cabinet-nod-for-20-world-class-institutions/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 24 May 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/hrd-ministry-seeks-cabinet-nod-for-20-world-class-institutions/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;India has taken a firm step towards building 20 world-class educational institutions, which will be termed Institutions of Eminence, with the human resource development ministry moving the proposal to the Union Cabinet for approval. Firmly bearing the stamp of the Prime Minister’s Office, this is a new framework to catapult Indian institutions to global recognition by freeing the best of them from the University Grants Commission’s restrictive regulatory regime and ushering in an unprecedented level of institutional autonomy. Here are some of the finer details:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-will-make-them-eminent&#34;&gt;WHAT WILL MAKE THEM ‘EMINENT’&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UGC (Institutions of Eminence Deemed to be Universities) regulations, 2017 will govern all such institutions that are conferred with this status, ensuring their complete academic, administrative and financial autonomy. These regulations will override all other UGC regulations and free the institutions of UGC’s restrictive inspection regime, the regulatory control over fee and curriculum.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://aadhaarcardnews.in/images/gr.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The institutions will have to achieve a place in the top 500 of any of the global rankings within 10 years of being declared an institution of eminence and eventually reach the top 100 slot&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;They will have a teacher:student ratio of 1:20 to begin with and 1:10 in five years, with a student enrolment of 15,000 in 15 years. There will be a good mix of Indian and international faculty, and only those who come with a degree from top 500 institutions in global rankings will be considered eligible foreign faculty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The institutions will be free to select students through a merit-based transparent admission process to ensure no meritorious student is turned away for lack of funds. Up to 30% foreign students vis-a-vis the strength of domestic students can be admitted. The institution will be free to decide its fee structure but will have to declare it in a transparent manner. Any reports of capitation fee will be treated as serious violation. An Ombudsman will be set up to cater to student grievances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;One paper will have to be published per faculty member per year on average in a reputed peer reviewed international journal, with publications included in SCOPUS, Web Science, etc to be counted as a research publication. A world-class library with subscriptions to reputed journals related to courses offered will have to be maintained along with cutting-edge research in frontier areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along-term lead campus (30 years minimum) with adequate space for expansion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;While private institutions will not get any government funding they will be able to access government funds for specific studies and projects they may execute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Full freedom to the institution to decide course structure, the credit hours needed for a degree, fixing of curriculum and syllabus and up to 20% online courses as part of its programmes and fully online certificate courses. Full freedom to hire faculty, even industry personnel as faculty and choose any career progression scheme, salary structure for its faculty. None of its academic collaborations will need government approval unless they are with countries on the foreign ministry’s or home ministry’s ‘negative list’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;who-is-eligible&#34;&gt;WHO IS ELIGIBLE&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ten government run and ten private institutions will be conferred this status, with Rs 10,000 crore funding earmarked for the former.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;While a government-owned institution will apply to HRD ministry for the special status, a private deemed to be university or private state university
will have to be backed by a sponsoring organisation with a total net worth of Rs 5,000 crore and credible members, an identified first chancellor and vice chancellor, and a detailed 15-year vision plan besides a five-year rolling implementation plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The governance structure of the institution and its sponsoring organisation will be different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;who-will-select&#34;&gt;WHO WILL SELECT&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;An empowered expert committee with three to five eminent persons appointed for three years with the final approval of the appointments committee of the Cabinet headed by the PM will select the 20 institutes. The EEC will recommend the names to the UGC, which will forward its decision to the HRD ministry that will issue a letter of intent to such institutions and decide on the final conferment of the status after a memorandum of understanding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;EEC will monitor and review the institutions of eminence to ensure quality, decide on appeals, changes in transfer of sponsorship and liquidation of corpus fund if necessitated amongother things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;These people will have to reply within 10 days to avoid any notice from the tax department or further enforcement action.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Income Tax department has identified 18 lakh people who have made &amp;lsquo;suspicious&amp;rsquo; cash deposits post demonetisation, including those having deposited over Rs 5 lakh, and will send emails and SMSes seeking explanation about their source of funds. These people will have to reply within 10 days to avoid any notice from the tax department or further enforcement action. The department on Tuesday launched &amp;lsquo;Operation Clean Money&amp;rsquo; project under which CBDT, with data analysis and profiling of assessees, will send e-communications to people whose cash deposits post November 8 note ban do not match their income.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Operation Clean Money/Swachh Dhan Abhiyan is a programming software which will be used to get answers on all the deposits made and after preliminary answers from the people. Then only, if need be, we would take legal action against those people,&amp;rdquo; Revenue Secretary Hasmukh Adhia said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) Chairman Sushil Chandra said 10 days&amp;rsquo; time would be given to people to reply to the e-communication and replies can be filed by logging on to the e-filing portal of the Income Tax department.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;In the initial phase, we are putting data of those persons who have deposited Rs 5 lakh or more and deposits between Rs 3 lakh and Rs 5 lakh of suspicious nature and who have poor tax compliance after November 8,&amp;rdquo; Chandra said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially, this will cover 18 lakh tax payers whose data will be uploaded on e-filing portal. These people while filing reply have to explain to tax department the sources of deposit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chandra said that tax department has compiled huge data which shows that there are over 1 crore accounts where above Rs 2 lakh money have been deposited and involves unique PAN of 70 lakh persons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We have compared these vast data with the income profile, turnover and the various other particulars of income available in the income tax data bank. In the first phase where the deposits in account are not matching with our data, we are putting the same on our e-filing portal seeking explanation of source of income,&amp;rdquo; he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chandra said the intention of the scheme is to avoid any harassment to the tax payer, they need not come to office and online verification would be completed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Swachh Dhan Abhiyan is a continuous exercise to widen and deepen the tax base. All the accounts in which money has been deposited will be tracked and we have hired the data analytics and we will identify the ultimate beneficiaries even in layered accounts,&amp;rdquo; he said.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>&#39;Pay Arrears Immediately&#39;: Income Tax Department Names Five Defaulters</title>
      <link>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/pay-arrears-immediately-income-tax-department-names/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The taxman has begun this exercise of naming and shaming tax defaulters for the last few years and had named at least 96 such entities which have huge tax liabilities on them and have either gone non-traceable or have shown no assets for recovery.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Income Tax Department on Thursday published names of five entities owing over Rs 10 crore in taxes, as part of its strategy to name and shame big defaulters. In an advertisement issued in leading national dailies, the department brought out the list of defaulters of income tax and corporate tax even as it advised them to pay their &amp;ldquo;tax arrears immediately&amp;rdquo;. The Income Tax Department has begun this exercise of naming and shaming tax defaulters for the last few years and had named at least 96 such entities which have huge tax liabilities on them and have either gone non-traceable or have shown no assets for recovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest list has names of five such alleged defaulters, based in Delhi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A senior official said the public list, with details of the individual or entity like their PAN card number (in certain cases), last known address and assessment range and defaulted amount of tax, is also aimed to make aware the people at large so that they can inform the department in case they have some inputs against them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The entries in the list are specific to the tax arrears and assessment year mentioned. The tax defaulter&amp;rsquo;s address, business, shareholding and management may have changed,&amp;rdquo; the notice issued by the Principal Chief Commissioner of Income Tax (New Delhi) said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The total taxes due by these five defaulters is Rs 10.27 crore, the notice said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT), the policy-making body of the Income Tax Department, had few years back adopted the strategy of bringing out the names of chronic defaulters in public domain and had also begun posting these names on its official website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the Income Tax Department recently launched an online facility to correct errors in names and other details in permanent account number (PAN) and Aadhaar documents. Alongside the facility to link biometric identifier Aadhaar with PAN, the department also put two separate hyperlinks on its e-filing website - one to update changes in existing PAN data or for application of new PAN by an Indian or a foreign citizen.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How To Check If Your Employer Has Deposited Your Income Tax</title>
      <link>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/26as-how-to-check-your-income-tax-credit/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In case there is a mismatch in TDS figures in Form 16 and Form 26AS, one should approach his/her employer or respective entity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tax return filing season has started from April 1. Usually, for many salaried employees, the first thing that comes to mind is Form 16 that is issued by employers. But another document - Form 26AS - is also a crucial document that a salaried individual should access before filing tax returns. Form 16 is a document from your employer, certifying that TDS or tax deducted at source has been deducted on your salary. Form 26AS is basically your tax credit statement which shows all taxes received by the Income Tax Department. You can access Form 26AS from the tax department&amp;rsquo;s website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It is extremely important to go through the Form 26AS to ensure that all due credits for TDS deducted from a person&amp;rsquo;s salary, FD interest, etc. are duly accounted for,&amp;rdquo; said Sandeep Sehgal, director of tax and regulatory at Ashok Maheshwary &amp;amp; Associates LLP. &amp;ldquo;Any shortfall of TDS reflected in Form 26AS than what is actually claimable in the income tax return will result in automatic generation of demand by Centralized Processing Centre of Income Tax Department subsequent to filing of income tax return.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conversely, it could also be problematic for the tax payer when excess TDS is reflected in Form 26AS. &amp;ldquo;Income Tax Department may question the person for the corresponding income which the person may not have shown in his/her income tax return. Hence, to avoid such hassles, it is necessary to tally the due TDS credit with Form 26AS,&amp;rdquo; adds Mr Sehgal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case there is a mismatch in TDS figures in Form 16 and Form 26AS, Mr Sehgal says the &amp;ldquo;person should approach the his/her employer or respective entity which has deducted TDS on any of his income and tell them to get their TDS return rectified to adjust.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The taxpayer can also see the refund received by him/her for previous assessment year in Form 26AS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;how-to-access-your-form-26as&#34;&gt;How to access your Form 26AS&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visit the income tax department&amp;rsquo;s website for tax filing (incometaxindiaefiling.gov.in) and log into your account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go to &amp;lsquo;My Account&amp;rsquo; tab and select Form 26AS from the drop down menu; After confirmation, the taxpayer will be directed to TDS Reconciliation Analysis and Correction Enabling System (TRACES) website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The taxpayer can then select the assessment year and format in which he/she would like to view Form 26AS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Password for Form 26AS PDF/text file is Date of Birth as printed on PAN card. Enter date in ddmmyyyy format to open file (e.g., for 10-Oct-2012, enter as 10102012).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taxpayers can also view Form 26AS through net banking facility. Select banks offer this facility.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Aadhaar essential for getting fellowships, scholarships from UGC, AICTE</title>
      <link>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/aadhaar-essential-getting-fellowships-scholarships-ugc-aicte/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 29 Apr 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/aadhaar-essential-getting-fellowships-scholarships-ugc-aicte/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;According to an order issued by the Human Resource Development (HRD) ministry on Wednesday, students seeking government scholarships and fellowships will need to declare Aadhaar numbers by the end of June, putting yet another of its benefits programme behind the Unique Identity project wall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The order covers fellowship schemes implemented by the University Grants Commission and the All India Council for Technical Education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The use of Aadhaar as identity document for delivery of services or benefits or subsidies simplifies the government delivery processes, brings in transparency and efficiency, and enables beneficiaries to get their entitlements directly in a convenient and seamless manner and Aadhaar obviates the need for producing multiple documents to prove one’s identity,” the government stated in its notification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students have till June 30 to declare their Aadhaar numbers, or apply for one and declare the enrolment number, to their respective colleges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The notification came into effect from Wednesday, covering all states excluding Assam, Meghalaya and Jammu and Kashmir.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As expected, activists have criticised the government’s move to make the Aadhaar programme – the enrolment to a national database with biometric information such as fingerprints and iris scans – must for those drawing state benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The criticism has centred around a Supreme Court order in September last year, when it said that people without UID numbers must not be denied assistance.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>PF Withdrawal Easier For Education, Hospital Bills: 10 Facts</title>
      <link>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/no-documents-just-self-declaration-for-provident-fund/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 29 Apr 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/no-documents-just-self-declaration-for-provident-fund/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;EFPO subscribers can seek withdrawal from their employee provident fund (EPF) account on various grounds by using a composite form along with a self-declaration.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EPFO or Employees&amp;rsquo; Provident Fund Organisation has made partial withdrawal easier from provident fund for medical and other purposes like purchase of house, education and marriage of children. The subscriber is no longer required to submit various certificates or documents. EFPO subscribers can seek withdrawal from their employee provident fund (EPF) account on various grounds by using a composite form along with a self-declaration. The submission of composite claim form signed by the EPF subscriber shall be construed as &amp;lsquo;self-certification&amp;rsquo; for partial withdrawals, according to the retirement fund body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here are 10 things to know:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) EPFO&amp;rsquo;s latest move to ease the withdrawal process will benefit nearly 4 crore subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) The subscribers can seek advance from the fund for treatment of illness in certain cases including hospitalisation lasting for one month or more, or major surgical operation in a hospital, or in case they are suffering from TB, leprosy, paralysis, cancer, mental derangement or heart ailment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) Earlier, the members were required to submit a certificate from a doctor of the hospital that the member or his dependent has been hospitalised or requires hospitalisation for one month or more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) Now after change in employee provident fund laws, a member would no longer be required to submit any medical certificate or document.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5) For medical purpose, an EPFO subscriber can withdraw up to six months of salary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6) EPPO has been taking a number of steps to ease withdrawal rules. Recently, it allowed subscribers to withdraw up to 90 per cent of their funds for home/land purchase. It also allowed payment of home loan EMIs by using the provident fund.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7) Partial provident fund withdrawal is also allowed for post-matriculation education of children and marriage purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8) For various withdrawal purposes, the subscriber is now only required to submit a self-declaration, which is included in a claim form, to avail advance from the provident fund.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;9) Subscribers who have seeded their Universal Account Number (UAN) with Aadhaar and bank account details can submit claim forms directly to EPFO without the attestation of employers. A universal account number allows provident fund number portability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;10) However, in cases where Aadhaar has not been seeded, the attestation of employers is required.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>how your petrol pump might be cheating you right in front of your eyes</title>
      <link>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/how-your-petrol-pump-might-be-cheating-you-in-front/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 29 Apr 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/how-your-petrol-pump-might-be-cheating-you-in-front/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A series of raids by Uttar Pradesh Special Task Force (STF) in Lucknow yesterday have revealed how petrol pumps are cheating consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most consumers only check the display of the fuel dispensing machine for the amount and the quantity of the fuel filled but the raids show that the pumps were using a remote-controlled electronic chip to dupe consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is how petrol pumps are cheating you:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Petrol pumps install a chip inside the fuel dispensing machine, which is designed to reduce the fuel output by nearly five to ten per cent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chip is attached to a wire, which sets the limit through a remote control. So, if you are buying one-litre of petrol, the machine will release only 940 ml.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such chips cost around Rs 3,000 a piece.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The STF suspects that the chips have been sold to a large number of pumps. As per STF estimate, a petrol pump using this chip earns an undue profit of around Rs 14 lakh per month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
