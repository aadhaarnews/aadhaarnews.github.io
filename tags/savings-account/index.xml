      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In a bid to curb corruption in the Public Distribution System (PDS), the Indian government had made the Aadhar Card mandatory for availing foodgrain subsidy at PDS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government has already made Aadhar Card mandatory for the cooking gas LPG subsidy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government has declared Rs 1.4 lakh crore subsidy under the food security law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A timeline till June 30 is given for the common people who avail subsidy to apply for Aadhar Card, the government categorically stated in the notification in this regard that no subsidised foodgrains with Aadhaar after June 30.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since November 2016, the Government of India, under the National Food Security Law (NFSA), has been providing 5 kg of foodgrains per person per month at Rs 1-3/kg to over 80 crore people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The notification has been applicable from February 8 in all States and Union Territories (UTs) except Assam, Meghalaya and Jammu and Kashmir. This move indicates Government’s serious intetion of digitisation to curb the corruption in PDS as well as a move towards a simplifies delivery process.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Idea To Sell 1GB 2G, 3G, 4G Mobile Data At Same Price From March End</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Idea sells 1GB of 2G service with about a month validity for around Rs 170 and 4G is priced around Rs 123.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;HIGHLIGHTS&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;At present, Idea mobile internet plans are priced at different rates&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision in the wake of stiff competition in the market&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Idea sells 1GB of 2G service with a month validity for Rs 170&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Telecom operator Idea Cellular will start selling 1GB and above mobile data plans across its 2G, 3G and 4G network at same price by the end of this month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Idea has now announced that it will allow open market data recharges of 1GB and above to work on Idea&amp;rsquo;s 2G, 3G or 4G network without any differential prices and this will be rolled out nationally by March 31, 2017,&amp;rdquo; Idea said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At present Idea mobile internet plans are priced at different rates. Due to stiff competition in the market from Reliance Jio, the 4G mobile data service of Idea is significantly cheaper than 2G service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Idea sells 1GB of 2G service with about a month validity for around Rs 170 and 4G is priced around Rs 123.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier, the high speed data plans were priced higher based on their download speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Customer can choose the recharge price basis usage and volume available in pack, without having to worry about the platform the customer&amp;rsquo;s device is logged in,&amp;rdquo; Idea Cellular Chief Marketing Officer Sashi Shankar said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Idea will bring all data product categories like sachets, freedom packs to unified pricing and will be rolled out nationally in phases by May 31.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;As Idea&amp;rsquo;s pan India broadband coverage continues to expand and reduces gap with existing 2G coverage which covers 4 lakh towns and villages, customers can now seamlessly migrate services between technology &amp;amp; platform without worrying about differential costs,&amp;rdquo; Shankar said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data limit in high speed internet plans gets exhausted in less time compared to that on slow speed network like 2G.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>No Proposal To Withdraw New 2,000 Rupee Notes: Arun Jaitley</title>
      <link>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/no-proposal-to-withdraw-new-2-000-rupee-notes-arun-jaitley/</link>

      <guid>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/no-proposal-to-withdraw-new-2-000-rupee-notes-arun-jaitley/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Rs 2,000 banknotes were introduced along with new Rs 500 currency following the withdrawal of old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes from November 9, 2016.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Friday said there is no proposal to withdraw the Rs 2,000 notes that were introduced post demonetisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Rs 2,000 banknotes were introduced along with new Rs 500 currency following the withdrawal of old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes from November 9, 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;There is no proposal to withdraw the Rs 2,000 denomination banknote,&amp;rdquo; the minister said in a written reply in the Lok Sabha.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Jaitley further said the Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes returned to currency chests of the RBI amounted to Rs 12.44 lakh crore (as on December 10, 2016).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data obtained in this regard would need to be reconciled with the physical cash balances to eliminate counterfeit notes, accounting errors and possible double counts after which only the final figures will be arrived at, he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He added that as on March 3, 2017 the currency in circulation was Rs 12 lakh crore and as on January 27, it was Rs 9.921 lakh crore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Jaitley said the cash recall seeks to create a new &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; wherein the GDP will be bigger, cleaner and real.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This exercise is part of the government&amp;rsquo;s resolve to eliminate corruption, blackmoney, counterfeit currency and terror funding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This exercise has resulted in an increase in deposits with banks. This will facilitate reduction of interest rates and provide more headroom to banks to expand their credit base,&amp;rdquo; the minister said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following demonetisation, several restrictions were imposed on withdrawal from banks as well as ATMs. The restrictions have been gradually removed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Plastic Rs 10 Note Could Be A Reality Soon</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has been authorised to conduct field trials for printing plastic Rs 10 denomination notes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has been authorised to conduct field trials for printing plastic Rs 10 denomination notes which will have a longer life span, Parliament was informed on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Approval for procurement of plastic substrate and printing of bank notes of Rs 10 denomination on plastic banknote substrates has been conveyed to the RBI,&amp;rdquo; Minister of State for Finance Arjun Ram Meghwal told the Lok Sabha in a written reply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Substrate denotes the underlying substance or layer on which currency is printed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The minister said the government had decided to conduct field trials at five locations of the country with plastic banknotes, which are expected to last longer than cotton substrate-based banknotes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>जल्द मिलेगा होम लोन कवर के साथ कम रेट का फायदा!</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;हाउजिंग फाइनैंस कंपनियों का रेग्युलेटर नैशनल हाउजिंग बैंक (NHB) इंश्योरेंस इंस्टीट्यूट ऑफ इंडिया के साथ मिलकर एक ऐसा व्यापक फ्रेमवर्क बनाने पर काम कर रहा है, जिसमें होम लोन का रेट आधा पर्सेंटेज पॉइंट तक घटेगा, बशर्ते लोन लेने वाले इंश्योरेंस कवर लें। मामले की जानकारी रखने वाले सूत्रों ने बताया कि इसका मकसद डिफॉल्ट रिस्क घटाना भी है।&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NHB के नैशनल डायरेक्टर और चीफ एग्जिक्युटिव ऑफिसर श्रीराम कल्याणरमन ने ईटी से बातचीत में इस खबर को सही बताया। उन्होंने कहा, &amp;lsquo;हम आपदा (संपत्ति) बीमा की संभावनाओं का पता लगाने के लिए इंश्योरेंस इंस्टीट्यूट ऑफ इंडिया के साथ मिलकर एक सर्वे कर रहे हैं। हम यह पता लगा रहे हैं कि क्या होम लोन लेते वक्त इंश्योरेंस कवर भी लेने पर कम लेंडिंग रेट ऑफर किया जा सकता है?&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;कल्याणरमन ने कहा, &amp;lsquo;इंश्योरेंस कवर से रिस्क प्रीमियम घटना चाहिए। इसका फायदा लेंडर्स कंज्यूमर्स को दे सकते हैं। यह प्रक्रिया पूरी होने पर आने वाले समय में हम एक व्यापक फ्रेमवर्क जारी करेंगे।&amp;rsquo; हाउजिंग फाइनैंस कंपनियों के बीच होम लोन बॉरोअर्स को प्रॉपर्टी इंश्योरेंस ऑफर करने का चलन बना है। मिसाल के लिए देश की सबसे बड़ी होम लोन प्रोवाइडर फर्म हाउजिंग डिवेलपमेंट फाइनैंस कॉर्पोरेशन (HDFC) प्रॉपर्टी इंश्योरेंस सहित नॉन-लाइफ इंश्योरेंस के लिए HDFC एर्गो प्रॉडक्ट्स ऑफर कर रही है। इसी तरह दीवान हाउजिंग फाइनैंस कॉर्पोरेशन (DHFL) अपनी शाखाओं के जरिए चोलामंडलम एमएस जनरल इंश्योरेंस प्रॉडक्ट्स बेचती है।&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ग्राहक ज्यादा कवरेज पर सस्ते प्रीमियम को तरजीह देते हैं। प्रॉपर्टी इंश्योरेंस आमतौर पर भूकंप, बाढ़, आतंकी घटनाओं, आगजनी से हुए नुकसान के अलावा साइक्लोन, आसमानी बिजली गिरने, तोड़फोड़ के चलते होने वाले वित्तीय घाटे से सुरक्षित करता है। फाइनैंशल इंस्टीट्यूशंस और बैंक की तरफ से कई मौकों पर कस्टमर्स को प्रॉपर्टी इंश्योरेंस लेने पर मजबूर किए जाने का आरोप लगता रहता है। बिहार, जम्मू कश्मीर, उत्तर प्रदेश, उत्तराखंड, गुजरात में हालिया प्राकृतिक आपदाओं ने स्टेकहोल्डर्स का घाटा घटाने के उपाय के तौर पर प्रॉपर्टी इंश्योरेंस की अहमियत बढ़ा दी है। मामले से जुड़े एग्जिक्युटिव ने कहा, &amp;lsquo;आधी कवायद हो चुकी है। हालांकि यह पूरी नहीं हुई है लेकिन इससे कम-से-कम आधा पर्सेंटेज पॉइंट का फायदा हो सकता है।&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;इस मामले को एक उदाहरण से समझने की कोशिश करते हैं। अभी एक रिटेल होम लोन बॉरोअर 20 साल के लिए 8.6% के रेट से 1 लाख रुपये के होम लोन पर 874 रुपये का ईएमआई चुकाता है। अब इस लोन का रेट 50 बेसिस पॉइंट घटा दिया जाता है तो होम लोन कस्टमर का ईएमआई घटकर 842 रुपये रह जाएगा। यह एस्टीमेट क्रेडिट रेटिंग कंपनी इकरा ने दिया है। इकरा के सीनियर वीपी कार्तिक श्रीनिवासन ने कहा, &amp;lsquo;ऐसे उपाय को अगर अंतिम रूप दे दिया जाता है तो बॉरोअर्स को बहुत मदद मिलेगी। इससे उनको अपना रिस्क प्रोफाइल बेहतर बनाने में तो मदद मिलेगी ही, उनकी लोन लेने की क्षमता भी बढ़ेगी। उनको कम रेट या ज्यादा लोन मिल सकता है। इंश्योरेंस कवर की लागत बॉरोअर्स को उठानी होगी, फिर भी उनको फायदा होगा क्योंकि ऊंचे इंट्रेस्ट रेट के नजरिए से प्रीमियम मामूली होगा।&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;एनएचबी का कहना है कि प्रॉपर्टी इंश्योरेंस के लिए पारदर्शी और सहज ट्रांजैक्शन सिस्टम होने से कंज्यूमर्स, बैंक, हाउजिंग फाइनैंस कंपनियों जैसे लेंडिंग इंस्टीट्यूशंस और इंश्योरेंस कंपनियों का कॉन्फिडेंस बढ़ेगा और इससे कंज्यूमर्स को प्रॉपर्टी इंश्योरेंस के लिए खुद आगे आने के लिए बढ़ावा मिलेगा।&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Funds Transferred From Provident Fund To NPS Not Taxable: Regulator</title>
      <link>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/funds-transferred-from-provident-fund-to-nps-not-taxable-regulator/</link>

      <guid>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/funds-transferred-from-provident-fund-to-nps-not-taxable-regulator/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The transferred recognised provident fund or superannuation fund will not be treated as contribution of the current year by employee/employer and the subscriber would not be required to claim tax deduction.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) on Tuesday said funds transferred from a provident fund account to a National Pension System (NPS) account will not attract any tax.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The amount so transferred from recognised Provident Fund/Superannuation Fund to NPS is not treated as income of the current year and hence not taxable,&amp;rdquo; it said while specifying procedure for effecting transfers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, the transferred recognised provident fund or superannuation fund will not be treated as contribution of the current year by employee/employer and the subscriber would not be required to claim tax deduction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2016-17 Budget, the government had announced that the subscribers from recognised Provident Funds and Superannuation Funds would be able to transfer their corpus from these funds to National Pension System (NPS) without any tax implication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A subscriber planning to transfer his PF funds will have to approach the Provident Fund/Superannuation Fund Trust through the current employer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The regulator said the NPS is gaining momentum in comparison to other retirement products and it was receiving a number of queries related to transfer of amounts to NPS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SBI&#39;s Move To Impose Minimum Balance Penalty Faces Government Hurdle</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;India&amp;rsquo;s biggest public sector bank, State Bank of India (SBI), announced that come April its savings bank account customers will have to maintain a higher monthly average balance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India&amp;rsquo;s biggest public sector bank, State Bank of India (SBI), announced that come April its savings bank account customers will have to maintain a higher monthly average balance, a move which is seen as hitting 31 crore depositors. Otherwise the account holders of the SBI will have to pay a penalty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Press Trust of India citing sources said that the government has asked SBI to reconsider its decision to levy penalty on non-maintenance of minimum balance. SBI has announced imposing penalty ranging from Rs. 20-100 on non-maintenance of Minimum Average Balance (MAB) in savings bank accounts from April 1. The penalty is as high as Rs. 500 in case of current accounts. The penalty for breach of minimum average balance is being reintroduced after a gap of five years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The monthly average balance (MAB) requirement has been increased to as high as Rs. 5,000 for branches in six metros. Savings bank account holders of SBI and its five associates - which will merge with it soon - will have to maintain the monthly balance. Else, they will have to pay a penalty ranging from Rs. 20 (in rural branches) to Rs. 100 (in metro cities).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Press Trust of India, also citing sources, said that SBI has been asked to reconsider charges it proposes to levy on cash transactions at branches over specified limits. Some private banks have started charging a minimum amount of Rs. 150 per transaction for cash deposits and withdrawals beyond four free transactions in a month.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>28 GB Data For Rs 345: Airtel&#39;s Latest Offer To Counter Jio</title>
      <link>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/28-gb-data-for-rs-345-airtels-latest-offer-to-counter-jio/</link>

      <guid>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/28-gb-data-for-rs-345-airtels-latest-offer-to-counter-jio/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Airtel&amp;rsquo;s Rs 345 offer offers comes days after billionaire investor Mukesh Ambani-controlled Reliance Jio announced a new &amp;lsquo;Prime&amp;rsquo; membership offer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tariff battle in the Indian telecom sector has further intensified with Bharti Airtel launching an aggressive mobile data plan to counter Reliance Jio. Market leader Bharti Airtel has announced a plan for select customers wherein its subscribers will be offered 28 GBs of  data along with free&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;local and STD calls for a period of 28 days under a pack priced at Rs 345. Airtel&amp;rsquo;s Rs 345 offer comes days after billionaire investor Mukesh Ambani-controlled Reliance Jio announced a new &amp;lsquo;Prime&amp;rsquo; membership offer, though it will charge for its services from April 1. Reliance Jio&amp;rsquo;s Prime plan&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;continues the benefits that the telecom arm of Reliance Industries had offered under its Happy New Year scheme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reliance Jio&amp;rsquo;s Rs 303 Prime offer, for example, gives Jio subscribers free voice calls and a daily cap of 1 GB of internet data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Airtel has also placed a limit on internet usage at 1 GB per day. Airtel customers can use 500 MBs of data during day and the remaining 500 MB data can be consumed between 12 am and 6 am, said a customer care executive of Bharti Airtel. Recently, Bharti Airtel chairman Sunil Mittal said that the&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;new tariff announced by Reliance Jio is very aggressive and unsustainable, and the industry will respond to it with more competitive plans and additional data offerings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Tariffs that they (Jio) have announced are still very aggressive, which means you got to respond. You got to do more packages&amp;hellip; you have to throw in more data. All those things need to be done,&amp;rdquo; he had said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Airtel had on February 27, 2017 waived domestic roaming charges to compete with free voice calls and roaming offered by Jio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jio has promised to match the best mobile data usage plan in the market and also add 20 per cent more data to it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The monthly average balance (MAB) requirement has been increased to as high as Rs 5,000 for branches in six metros.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;State Bank of India, the country&amp;rsquo;s biggest lender, has decided to increase manifold the minimum balance required for maintaining savings account from April 1, hitting 31 crore depositors including pensioners and students.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>All banks must enable mobile banking by March 31: Government</title>
      <link>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/all-banks-must-enable-mobile-banking-by-march-31-government/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 05 Mar 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/all-banks-must-enable-mobile-banking-by-march-31-government/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The government on Friday said it has asked banks to provide mobile banking facility to all customers by the end of the current fiscal on March 31.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a move to promote digital transactions post-demonetisation, the government on Friday said it has asked banks to provide mobile banking facility to all customers by the end of the current fiscal on March 31. “Ministry issues advisory to banks to enable mobile seeding, Aadhaar seeding of bank&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;accounts along with enablement of Mobile Banking for all its savings bank customers on a campaign mode by March 31, 2017,” an Electronics and IT Ministry (MeitY) statement in Delhi said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“As per an estimate, currently only 65 per cent saving accounts are seeded with mobile numbers and only 50 per cent are seeded with Aadhaar numbers. Out of the 65 per cent accounts already seeded with mobile numbers, only 20 per cent are enabled for mobile banking,” it said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make the process of 100 per cent seeding of bank accounts convenient to customers, the ministry “has advised the banks to explore ‘Over the Air’ customer consent instead of requiring customers to visit the bank branch or ATM as is required currently,” the statement added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Declaring that the process of enabling the bank accounts for mobile and Aadhaar-based banking is “completely voluntary”, the statement said: “However, given the benefits of these banking channels, a large number of customers are expected to opt for it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking to reporters earlier this week, IT Secretary Aruna Sundarajan elaborated on the rationale behind the move following the recent demonetisation of high value currency and the government’s campaign to encourage digital transactions.
“The reason is earlier mobile banking wasn’t such a priority. And therefore, many customers may not have said they want mobile banking services. But today, they want it,” she said&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sundarajan also said customers who are using the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) or Bharat Interface for Money (BHIM) payment app should be automatically enabled for mobile banking.
“We have said that any customer who accesses UPI or BHIM, should automatically be enabled for mobile banking because it means they want mobile banking. This is to ensure that whoever wants to do mobile banking but has not been enabled, should be enabled by March 31,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SBI Announces Penalty For Not Keeping Minimum Balance In Accounts </title>
      <link>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/sbi-announces-penalty-for-non-maintenance-of-minimum-balance/</link>

      <guid>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/sbi-announces-penalty-for-non-maintenance-of-minimum-balance/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Making maintenance of Rs 5,000 mandatory for accounts in metropolitan areas, Rs 3,000 in urban areas, Rs 2,000 in semi-urban areas and Rs 1,000 in rural areas, the SBI listed out the charges to be effective from April 1.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making it compulsory for account-holders to maintain a minimum balance, the State Bank of India (SBI) on Thursday said it will be charging defaulters a penalty from April 1 onwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making maintenance of Rs 5,000 mandatory for accounts in metropolitan areas, Rs 3,000 in urban areas, Rs 2,000 in semi-urban areas and Rs 1,000 in rural areas, the SBI listed out the charges to be effective from April 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These charges will be based on the difference between the minimum balance required and the shortfall. For metropolitan areas, if the shortfall is greater than 75 per cent. the charges would be Rs 100 plus service tax.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the shortfall is between 50-75 per cent, the bank would charge Rs 75 plus service tax and for below 50 per cent shortfall, a fee of Rs 50 plus service tax would be levied, according to the SBI notification of new charges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, for rural areas, the penalty for non-maintenance of minimum balance ranges from Rs 20-50 plus service tax, it said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The public sector lender would also renew from April 1, the Rs 50 charge for people carrying out over three cash transactions at its branch within a month. This charge is applicable currently as well. However, there is no upper limit on the amount of cash transacted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;These cash transaction charges at branches are already existing. The same have been renewed for the next financial year from April 1. It is to deter the customers from visiting the branch but the charges are very nominal. As it is, the customer does not need to visit the branch often because we provide 10 free withdrawals in a month from ATMs,&amp;rdquo; a SBI official told IANS.&lt;/p&gt;
