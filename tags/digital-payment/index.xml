&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Savings and salary account customers of HDFC Bank will now have four free cash transactions (which include both cash deposit and withdrawal) per month.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India&amp;rsquo;s leading private sector lender HDFC Bank has raised charges on cash transactions at bank branches, effective from March 1. An HDFC Bank official said that the charges on cash transactions at branches are being raised with an objective to promote digital payments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;here-are-10-things-to-know&#34;&gt;Here are 10 things to know:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Savings and salary account customers of HDFC Bank will now have four free cash transactions (which include both cash deposit and withdrawal) per month over the counter at bank branches. From the fifth transaction onwards, the customers will have to pay a minimum of Rs 150 per transaction (plus taxes and cess).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) Earlier, HDFC Bank savings account customers were offered five free transactions and the sixth transaction was charged at Rs 100.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) HDFC Bank after December 30, 2016 reintroduced charges on cash transactions at branches after the deadline to deposit old currency notes ended. The charges were waived off after the government had announced a ban on high value currency notes on November 8.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) According to the revised norms which came into effect from March 1, from non-home branch, HDFC Bank customers can deposit/withdraw up to Rs 25,000 per day without any charge but any deposit/withdrawal from non-home branch above Rs 25,000 will attract charge of Rs 5 per thousand or Rs 150 (plus taxes and cess), whichever is higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5) At the home branch of HDFC Bank, if the cumulative cash transactions (deposit/withdrawal) exceed Rs 2 lakh, a transaction charge of Rs 5 per thousand or Rs 150 (plus taxes and cess) whichever is higher will be levied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6) For example, if a customer withdraws Rs 2 lakh from an account in four transactions and goes for another fifth transaction of Rs 50,000 from the home branch, then the customer will have to pay a charge of Rs 250. Thus, the charges apply only on the fifth transaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7) However, the charges for withdrawing money from automatic teller machines (ATMs) remain unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8) For senior citizens and minor accounts, the limit of Rs 25,000 per day will be applicable but the accounts will not be charged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;9) India&amp;rsquo;s biggest private sector bank ICICI Bank had reintroduced the cash transaction charges at bank branches from January 1, 2017. There will be no charge for first four transactions a month at branches in home city while thereafter Rs 5 per Rs 1,000 would be charged thereafter subject to a minimum of Rs 150. The third party limit is Rs 50,000 per day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;10) Meanwhile, news agency Press Trust of India reported that another private sector lender Axis Bank has also started charging a minimum amount of Rs 150 per transaction for cash deposits and withdrawals beyond four free transactions in a month.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bank accounts opened between July 1, 2014 and August 31, 2015 need to submit self-certification by April 30 to comply with FATCA (Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act) provisions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bank accounts opened between July 1, 2014 and August 31, 2015 need to submit self-certification by April 30 to comply with FATCA (Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act) provisions, without which the accounts would be blocked, the income tax department said. &amp;ldquo;The account holders may be informed that, in case self-certifications are not provided till April 30, 2017, the accounts would be blocked, which would mean that the financial institution would prohibit the account holder from effecting any transaction with respect to such accounts,&amp;rdquo; the Central Board of Direct Taxes or CBDT said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Account holders are informed that, in case self-certifications are not provided till 30.4.2017,A/Cs would be blocked : pic.twitter.com/YICvRHqfPm
â€” Income Tax India (@IncomeTaxIndia) April 11, 2017&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are 10 things to know:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) FATCA allows automatic exchange of financial information between India and the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) India had entered into an agreement with the United States for implementation of the Foreign Accounts Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) with effect from August 31, 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) Investors are required to provide details such as country of tax residence, tax identification number from such country, country of birth, country of citizenship etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) If the accounts are blocked due to lack of self-certification, then transactions by the account holder in such blocked accounts will be permitted once the self-certification is obtained and due diligence is completed, the tax department said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5) Earlier, the financial institutions had to obtain self-certification from account holders by August 31, 2016, in respect of all individual and entity accounts opened from July 1, 2014-August 31, 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6) Mutual funds and other financial institutions had also asked customers to comply with the new norms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7) In view of the difficulties faced by stakeholders, the tax department had on August 31, 2016, extended the deadline for complying with self-certification norms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8) The financial institutions were advised to continue to work on completing the required due diligence, including obtaining self-certifications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;9) The purpose of FATCA is aimed at ensuring that individuals pay tax on income generated from their wealth parked overseas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;10) FATCA obliges such banks and financial institutions to report such information about citizens having accounts with them. (With agency inputs)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Banks Get Time Till June 30 To Obtain PAN From Account Holders</title>
      <link>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/banks-get-time-till-june-30-to-obtain-pan-from-account-holders/</link>

      <guid>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/banks-get-time-till-june-30-to-obtain-pan-from-account-holders/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Though the deadline for getting the PAN or Form 60 (if PAN is not available) by banks ended on February 28, the tax department on April 5 notified the extension of the time till June 30.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tax department has given banks three more months till June 30 to obtain permanent account number (PAN) or Form-60 from all account holders as it looks to tighten the noose around evaders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though the deadline for getting the PAN or Form 60 (if PAN is not available) by banks ended on February 28, the tax department on April 5 notified the extension of the time till June 30.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the notification, the Income Tax Department said that in Income-Tax Rules 114B, in the fourth proviso, &amp;ldquo;for the figures, letters and words &amp;lsquo;28th day of February&amp;rsquo; the figures, letters and words &amp;lsquo;30th day of June&amp;rsquo; shall be substituted.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rule 114B lists various transactions for which quoting PAN is mandatory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tax department had in January asked banks, post offices and cooperative banks to document PAN or declaration of Form 60 received from account holders and maintain all records for transactions under Rule 114B of I-T Act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It had said that persons who have not quoted PAN, or did not furnish Form 60 at the time of opening account, will have to provide the same by February 28. Form 60 is a declaration form filed by an individual without PAN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the demonetisation move effective November 9, the tax department had asked banks and post offices to report to it all deposits above Rs 2.5 lakh in savings accounts and more than Rs 12.50 lakh in current accounts made between November 10 and December 30, 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, cash deposits exceeding Rs 50,000 in a single day had to be reported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With an estimated Rs 15 lakh crore in junked currency notes coming back into the banking system post demonetisation, the tax department has started analysing the bank deposit trends.&lt;/p&gt;

Executive vice-chairman Uday Kotak said it has been named &amp;ldquo;811&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;inspired by November 8, 2016, &amp;ldquo;the day that changed India&amp;rdquo; referring to Prime Minister Narendra Modi&amp;rsquo;s announcement of high value notes last year. The 811 scheme offers a &amp;ldquo;completely digital, paperless account opening experience&amp;rdquo; through Kotak Bank&amp;rsquo;s app in five minutes, he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It is inspired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi&amp;rsquo;s November 8 (demonetisation) move. The inspiration is from PM Modi&amp;rsquo;s vision of new India,&amp;rdquo; he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key things to know about Kotak&amp;rsquo;s 811 savings account scheme:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) &amp;ldquo;811&amp;rdquo; is part of Kotak&amp;rsquo;s existing banking app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) Kotak&amp;rsquo;s 811 account will offer users an interest rate of up to 6 per cent on savings account balances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) The 811 scheme offers &amp;ldquo;zero balance with zero charges&amp;rdquo; for all digital transactions, Mr Kotak said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) Only Aadhaar and PAN numbers are required to open and operate it, he added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5) The 811 savings account scheme offers over 100 features including financial transactions management, online shopping, booking of movie tickets, flights and hotel rooms, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6) The app is also Unified Payment Interface or UPI-enabled which lets you send and receive money without adding any other bank information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7) Kotak is the first bank to integrate the newly introduced Aadhaar-based OTP on mobile, he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8) It is a combination of a regular bank account, mobile account and a digital wallet which gives access to e-commerce, Mr Kotak said.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Now, You Can Get A PAN Or TAN Within A Day</title>
      <link>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/now-you-can-get-a-pan-or-tan-within-a-day/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In addition to physical PAN card, CBDT has introduced the Electronic PAN (e-PAN) card, which is sent by email to all applicants, including individuals.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Income Tax department today said it has issued Permanent Account Number (PAN) within a day to 19,704 newly incorporated companies till March 31, 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to physical PAN card, CBDT has introduced the Electronic PAN (e-PAN) card, which is sent by email to all applicants, including individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Applicant would be benefited by having a digitally signed E-PAN card which they can submit as proof of identity to other agency electronically directly or by storing in the Digital Locker (&lt;a href=&#34;https://digilocker.gov.in),&amp;quot;&#34;&gt;https://digilocker.gov.in),&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; CBDT, the apex policy making body of the Income Tax department, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It said that newly incorporated companies have also been issued Tax Deduction Account Number (TAN) simultaneously with PAN as the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has tied up with the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) under which companies can submit a common application form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applicant companies submit a common application form SPICe (INC 32) on MCA portal and once the data of incorporation is sent to CBDT by the MCA, PAN and TAN are issued immediately without any further intervention of the applicant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Certificate of Incorporation (COI) of newly incorporated companies includes the PAN in addition to the Corporate Identity Number (CIN). TAN is also allotted simultaneously and communicated to the company,&amp;rdquo; the statement added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Till March 31, 2017, 19,704 newly incorporated companies were allotted PAN in this manner. During March 2017, of the 10,894 newly incorporated companies, PAN was allotted within 4 hours in 95.63 per cent cases and within one day in all cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, TAN was allotted to all such companies within 4 hrs in 94.7 per cent cases and within 1 day in 99.73 per cent cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;CBDT&amp;rsquo;s initiative in starting of a business is expected to significantly improve the ranking of India in the Ease of Doing Business Study conducted by World Bank by reducing the number of processes of registration before various authorities under law, reducing the time taken for allotment of the registration number (CIN, PAN, TAN) and making the entire registration process for new companies much simpler,&amp;rdquo; it said.&lt;/p&gt;

      <link>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/provident-fund-deposits-to-earn-rs-50-000-more-under-new-scheme/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The benefit will also be provided in case of permanent disability even if the members have contributed for less than 20 years, the EPFO board has decided.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Retirement fund body EPFO&amp;rsquo;s subscribers will get loyalty-cum-life benefit of up to Rs 50,000 at the time of retirement for contributing to the scheme for 20 years or more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The benefit will also be provided in case of permanent disability even if the members have contributed for less than 20 years, the EPFO board has decided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Employees&amp;rsquo; Provident Fund Organisation&amp;rsquo;s (EPFO) apex decision making body, the Central Board of Trustees (CBT), has recommended a minimum sum assured of Rs 2.5 lakh in the event of death of a subscriber.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The CBT has recommended amending the Employees&amp;rsquo; Deposit Linked Insurance Scheme (EDLI) to provide for minimum benefit of Rs 2.5 lakh and loyalty-cum-life benefit of up to Rs 50,000 at a meeting held yesterday,&amp;rdquo; a senior official said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The suggested benefits will be available to members after government approval. Initially, these will be provided for two years on a pilot basis and will be reviewed thereafter.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the proposal, loyalty-cum-life benefit will be provided to all those members on retirement at 58 or 60 years who have contributed to the scheme for 20 years or more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The benefit will also be provided in case of permanent disability. In these cases, the members who have contributed to the EDLI scheme for less than 20 years will be eligible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those members whose average basic wages are up to Rs 5,000 will get loyalty-cum-life benefit of Rs 30,000. Similarly, the members with wages of Rs 5,001-10,000 Will be eligible for Rs 40,000 benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All those members getting more than Rs 10,000 monthly wage will be eligible for Rs 50,000 loyalty-cum-life benefit under the proposed scheme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The board has recommended such benefits in view of a huge EDLI corpus of Rs 18,119 crore following addition of interest that accrued on investment of this fund.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At present, the dependants of the deceased get a sum assured of up to Rs 6 lakh. There is no provision of minimum insurance and any benefit for surviving members or in cases of permanent disability under the scheme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Labour Minister Bandaru Dattatreya launched Aadhaar Seeding Application after the meeting. The EPFO has developed this application with support of Common Service Centres (CSCs) and C-DAC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CSCs are ICT-enabled front-end service delivery points at the village level for delivery of government and private services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With implementation of the seeding application, a PF member or pensioner can now walk into any of the field offices of EPFO or CSC outlets with UAN and Aadhaar and seed them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EPFO enrolled 49,39,929 workers during January-March 2017. It had launched a special enrolment scheme to cover leftout formal sector workers from January 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;EPFO has extended the deadline for submitting digital life certificates for its over 50 lakh pensioners till April 30 to link pension accounts with Aadhaar.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From interest rate for 2016-17 to Aadhaar to a new loyalty scheme, there has been a lot of news coming from EPFO or Employees Provident Fund Organisation that manages your provident fund money. EPFO has extended the deadline for submitting Aadhaar number to April 30, 2017 for its over four crore members. The Employees&amp;rsquo; Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) had set March 31, 2017 as the deadline for submitting Aadhaar number earlier. EPFO has also extended the deadline for submitting digital life certificates for its over 50 lakh pensioners till April 30 to link pension accounts with Aadhaar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;here-are-the-other-developments&#34;&gt;Here are the other developments:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;EPFO&amp;rsquo;s subscribers will get loyalty-cum-life benefit of up to Rs 50,000 at the time of retirement for contributing to the scheme for 20 years or more. The benefit will also be provided in case of permanent disability even if the members have contributed for less than 20 years, the EPFO board has decided. The benefits will be available for EPFO subscribers after approval from the government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;EPFO&amp;rsquo;s apex decision-making body the Central Board of Trustees (CBT) has recommended a minimum sum assured of Rs 2.5 lakh in the event of death of a subscriber. At present, the dependants of the deceased get a sum assured of up to Rs 6 lakh. There is no provision of minimum insurance and any benefit for surviving members or in cases of permanent disability under the scheme. The benefits will be available for EPFO subscribers after approval from the government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 4 crore subscribers of EPFO will get 8.65 per cent interest on provident fund deposits for 2016-17, as decided by the organisation&amp;rsquo;s trustees in December, Labour Minister Bandaru Dattatreya has said. The comments follow reports suggesting that the Finance Ministry is nudging the Labour Ministry to lower the EPF interest rate by up to 50 basis points. &amp;ldquo;It is not like that. The CBT (EPFO trustees) had decided to give 8.65 per cent. Our ministry keeps on discussing with Finance Ministry. We would have surplus of Rs 158 crore on providing 8.65 per cent,&amp;rdquo; Mr Dattatreya said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The board of retirement fund body EPFO deferred the proposal to raise investment in stock market to 15 per cent of its investible deposits from current 10 per cent. &amp;ldquo;It was proposed to increase investments in the Exchanges Traded Funds to 15 per cent. But trade unions representatives opposed it,&amp;rdquo; an EPFO trustee said after the meeting. The EPFO has invested Rs 18,069 crore in exchange trade funds (ETFs) till February 18, 2017 and yielded a return of 18.13 per cent on these investments. Earlier, Labour Minister Bandaru Dattatreya had indicated that the EPFO will increase its investment in ETFs in the backdrop of good returns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly four crore members of retirement fund body EPFO will soon be able to settle their claims like EPF withdrawal through mobile application UMANG. &amp;ldquo;The Employees&amp;rsquo; Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) is developing online claims settlement process by receiving application online,&amp;rdquo; Labour Minister Bandaru Dattatreya said in a written reply to the Lok Sabha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>70 GB 4G Data At Rs 244, Rs 399: Airtel&#39;s New Plans To Counter Jio &#39;Dhan Dhana Dhan&#39;</title>
      <link>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/70-gb-4g-data-at-rs-244-rs-399-airtels-new-plans-to-counter-jio/</link>

      <guid>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/70-gb-4g-data-at-rs-244-rs-399-airtels-new-plans-to-counter-jio/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;After withdrawing the &amp;lsquo;Summer Surprise&amp;rsquo; offer, Jio has come up with Dhan Dhana Dhan&amp;rsquo; plans offering unlimited data, SMS and voice calling for three months.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://aadhaarcardnews.in/images/bharti-airtel-650_650x400_81492158840.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;With the tariff war getting brutal in the telecom space, India&amp;rsquo;s biggest operator Airtel has come up with aggressive new prepaid plans to counter Reliance Jio&amp;rsquo;s latest &amp;lsquo;Dhan Dhana Dhan&amp;rsquo; offer. Under Rs 244 plan, Airtel is offering unlimited local and STD calls on Airtel network and 1 GB/day for 70 days. Under the Rs 399 plan, Airtel is offering free local and STD calls on any network as well as 1 GB/day data for 70 days. Under the Rs 345 plan, Airtel is offering unlimited call and 2GB data/day for 28 days. A check on Airtel&amp;rsquo;s website showed these new plans are available for subscription on prepaid numbers through online payment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After withdrawing the &amp;lsquo;Summer Surprise&amp;rsquo; offer, Jio has come up with Dhan Dhana Dhan&amp;rsquo; plans offering unlimited data, SMS and voice calling for three months. Starting Rs 309, &amp;lsquo;Jio Dhan Dhana Dhan&amp;rsquo; plan offers 1 GB data per day for a period of 84 days. Also, with a recharge of Rs 509, users will get 2 GB data per day for 84 days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reliance Jio&amp;rsquo;s aggressive entry into the telecom space has led to a drop in tariffs as the competition gets intense. The revenue of telecom sector from consumer services like mobile telephony and data dipped 10.5 per cent to Rs 37,284 crore in the October-December period over the previous three months, according to regulator Trai.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aggressive offerings from telecom operators have led higher data usage. Two out of three consumers in India want to switch to a new phone within the next 12 months, a report by Counterpoint Research said. &amp;ldquo;As per the survey, two in three users plan to upgrade to a new mobile phone in the next 12 months. This is a departure from an average of 24-30 months to under 20 months upgrade cycle,&amp;rdquo; the report said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;State Bank of India is offering corporate salary accounts without the requirement to maintain minimum monthly balance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;State Bank of India or SBI has said it is exempting its customers holding certain account types from maintenance of average monthly balance. Such accounts include small savings bank accounts, basic savings bank accounts and Jan Dhan accounts, or the accounts opened under the government&amp;rsquo;s financial inclusion scheme Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana or PMJDY. This was said in a tweet by SBI, which recently adopted a new brand identity after merger with five associate banks and Bharatiya Mahila Bank. SBI had earlier decided to increase the minimum balance required for maintaining savings accounts from April 1, hitting 31 crore depositors including pensioners and students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides, State Bank of India is also offering corporate salary accounts without the requirement to maintain minimum monthly balance.

&lt;p&gt;The monthly average balance (MAB) requirement was increased to as high as Rs 5,000 for branches in six metros. In case of non-compliance, savings bank account holders will invite a penalty ranging from Rs 20 (in rural branches) to Rs. 100 (in metro cities), as per the bank&amp;rsquo;s website. (Read more)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the other features SBI offers under these accounts, according to its website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;small-savings-bank-account&#34;&gt;Small savings bank account&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SBI&amp;rsquo;s small savings bank account has a maximum balance limit of Rs 50,000 and offers a rate of interest applicable to savings bank accounts. Account holders get an ATM-cum-Debit card, issued free of cost and without any annual maintenance charge, as per the SBI website. All credits in a financial year should not aggregate to more than Rs 1 lakh and Rs 10,000 in case of withdrawals and transfers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;basic-savings-account&#34;&gt;Basic savings account&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SBI&amp;rsquo;s basic savings account has no minimum balance or maximum balance limits. Holders of this account type &amp;ldquo;will not be eligible to open any other Savings Bank Account&amp;rdquo; at the bank. Such an account - in case the customer already holds one - will have to be closed within 30 days of opening the basic savings bank deposit account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;corporate-salary-package&#34;&gt;Corporate salary package&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SBI&amp;rsquo;s salary account under corporate salary package offers many benefits to the employer and the employee alike. This account type reduces employer&amp;rsquo;s paperwork and salary administration cost. Employees get free internet banking and mobile banking services, among other features, as per the SBI website.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Know how Aadhaar Pay works</title>
      <link>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/game-changer-digital-push-know-aadhaar-pay-works/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 14 Apr 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/game-changer-digital-push-know-aadhaar-pay-works/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Narendra Modi today launched Aadhaar Pay at Nagpur on the birth anniversary of the Father of Indian Constitution Dr Bhim Rao Ambedkar. The app is expected to revolutionise digital payments, especially in rural India, as it is extremely easy to use for merchants as well as customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the governmentâ€™s digital payments campaign, Aadhaar Pay comes after the launch of the BHIM App on December 30. While launching the BHIM app, PM Modi had said more work was being done which would increase the power of BHIM so much that people would be able to withdraw money even with fingerprints&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the government launched BHIM as a payment application for peer-to-peer transactions post demonetisation, Aadhaar Pay is meant for merchants to receive digital payments from customers over the counter through Aadhaar authentication. The government has named the new payments system as BHIM-Aadhaar sewa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aadhaar Pay will be supported by 20 banks initially. The government has requested all public sector banks to go live with Aadhaar Pay and the National Payments Corporation of India, the implementing agency for Aadhaar Enabled Payments Systems, has extended help to the banks to ensure smooth onboarding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;a-game-changer-app&#34;&gt;A game-changer app&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While, so far, digital payments have been dependent on credit/debit cards and mobile phones, Aadhaar Pay wonâ€™t require a phone or a card. Even if a user cannot read or write, he would be able to use it. Low mobile-phone penetration and digital literacy are considered big obstacles in the governmentâ€™s plan to involve the masses in the digital payments system. Aadhaar Pay will face no such obstacles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;how-aadhaar-pay-works&#34;&gt;How Aadhaar Pay works&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This app is only for merchants. A merchant has to download the app on a smartphone, connect the app to his bank account and link the phone to a biometric scan machine. To make payment, the customer just have to give his fingerprint. The customer must have an Aadhaar-linked bank account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;free-transactions&#34;&gt;Free transactions&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since transaction charges discourage adoption of digital payments, especially in small towns and rural India, the Aadhaar Pay will levy no transaction fee on the merchant or the customer unlike the card-based digital payments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;a-secure-app&#34;&gt;A secure app&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the Niti Aayog, the Aadhaar Pay is a safe app that uses two main platformsâ€”Aadhaar Payment Bridge (APB) and Aadhaar Enabled Payment System (AEPS). APB will act as repository between the banks and the customers to provide a smooth flow of transactions, while AEPS will help in authenticating the online process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;a-secure-app-1&#34;&gt;A secure app&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the Niti Aayog, the Aadhaar Pay is a safe app that uses two main platformsâ€”Aadhaar Payment Bridge (APB) and Aadhaar Enabled Payment System (AEPS).

&lt;h1 id=&#34;incentives-scheme&#34;&gt;Incentives scheme&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aadhaar Pay comes with incentives for merchants and customers-cash back and referral bonus. Under the referral bonus scheme, both the existing user who refers BHIM and the new user who adopts BHIM would get a cash bonus credited directly to their account. Under the cashback scheme, the merchants will get a cashback on every transaction using BHIM. The government has an outlay of Rs 495 crore for the scheme which will run till October 14.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why ATMs Are Going Dry</title>
      <link>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/atms-going-dry-ambedkar-replacing-gandhi-new-face-money/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 14 Apr 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/atms-going-dry-ambedkar-replacing-gandhi-new-face-money/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;1: The ATM expansion era is over. ATM extensions will no longer be part of future banking growth, and future ATMs may well be of the mobile kind focused only on rural cash deliveries. But even here, the growth will be limited. Standalone ATM companies may have a future, but only because banks may choose to outsource all their existing networks to them so that they can focus on growing the digital business themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2: The phenomenon of business correspondents will rise in the short run, and then collapse as rural and unbanked sectors accept digital cash as the way to transfer money. The limiting factors are the absence of reliable power supplies in remote areas, and the gap in the spread of mobile phones to the poor. These shortcomings will be addressed over the next five years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3: Once ATMs and cash start falling in terms of importance, the cash logistics business will, perforce, have to shrink. It is already in trouble after a few months of glory during the peak weeks of demonetisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4: Many banking services may be outsourced. As ATMs shrink, branch rationalisation will also be the order of the day. Banks may outsource one-time customer-acquisition operations and use Aadhaar-based-eKYC to grow their customer bases, as Kotak Mahindra Bankâ€™s 811 account is trying to do. E-KYC will soon become the standard way of acquiring new customers, both for regular banks and payment banks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5: Cyber security will see a boom. As digital cash becomes the norm, the real growth in financial sector jobs will be in cyber security, since digital currency systems are vulnerable to hacking and fraud. For example, the unified payments interface (UPI) which allows for peer-to-peer payments using mobile phone numbers could be vulnerable to fraudsters who manage to clone your SIM card. In the past, fraudsters have cloned ATM magnetic strips; next they will target SIMs. Since smartphones will essentially become your digital banking interface, technologies to protect you from losses when you misplace or lose your phone will become paramount.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6: Credit cards and payments systems will move out of the physical category and turn virtual. In future, credit and debit cards may be embedded in your phone, as the new Samsung Pay product indicates. Samsung Pay uses finger-print authorisation and PIN for payment at merchant nodes without any physical card having to be swiped. Kotakâ€™s 811 app-based bank account offers virtual debit cards and scan-and-pay options. Once the Bharat QR Code becomes widely adopted by merchants, e-wallets too will become interoperable like credit cards issued by various banks are now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7: Phishing and fraud insurance will become big business. Once the smartphone becomes your wallet, you have to buy insurance to cover yourself against the possibility of fraud. Credit card fraud insurance is not big in India, but digital cash fraud may need better insurance than cards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8: The biggest business of them all will be data analytics. As bank charges and payment usage fees fall to low levels, both due to regulation and high-volume usage, banks, virtual banks, card companies, and e-wallets will have to make money from the customer data they now own, as Aadhaar man Nandan Nilekani has repeatedly emphasised. This means financial companies must understand customers better from their spending and payments habits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;9: Bank employment will fall, as banks hollow out in terms of physical infrastructure and some jobs get outsourced. But they will pay top dollar to techies, since banking is being taken over by technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India is on the cusp of a huge shift in its financial sector. The old certainties are gone. The jobs market is shifting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reassuring face of Gandhi on the currency note, with all its certainties, will be replaced with the virtual face of Bhimrao Ambedkar, the Modi governmentâ€™s mascot for digital cash, with all its exciting uncertainties.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>After Jio&#39;s &#39;Summer Surprise&#39; Comes &#39;Dhan Dhana Dhan&#39; Offer: Features, Price And More</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Jio makes India the highest quality, most affordable data market in the world so that every Indian can do Datagiri,&amp;rdquo; Jio said.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jio has announced a new scheme called &amp;ldquo;Dhan Dhana Dhan&amp;rdquo;, offering &amp;ldquo;unlimited&amp;rdquo; data under recharge packs starting from Rs 309. &amp;ldquo;Dhan Dhana Dhan&amp;rdquo; from Reliance Jio Infocomm - the telecom arm of billionaire Mukesh Ambani-led conglomerate Reliance Industries - comes days after of the new entrant deciding to withdraw its &amp;ldquo;Summer Surprise&amp;rdquo; offer on telecom regulator TRAI&amp;rsquo;s advice. &amp;ldquo;In order to smoothen the migration from free to paid services, Jio has implemented simple, affordable and regulatory compliant plans in customer interest,&amp;rdquo; Jio said in a release on the Dhan Dhana Dhan scheme. Like its earlier &amp;ldquo;Summer Surprise&amp;rdquo; offer, &amp;ldquo;Dhan Dhana Dhan&amp;rdquo; recharges will further boost Jio&amp;rsquo;s already strong customer retention under Prime as well as attract new customers to its fold, say analysts. (Also read: &amp;lsquo;Your first recharge an auspicious moment for Jio&amp;rsquo;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reliance Jio in a statement on Tuesday said it has fully withdrawn its Summer Surprise offer &amp;ldquo;following the advice of Telecom Regulatory Authority of India&amp;rdquo;. For members of its Prime services, Jio announced new &amp;ldquo;all unlimited&amp;rdquo; plans &amp;ldquo;aimed at encouraging Jio subscribers to live the Digital Life without restrictions - Jio Dhan Dhana Dhan!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How to get &amp;ldquo;Dhan Dhana Dhan&amp;rdquo; benefits&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are an existing Jio customer but have not bought your first Jio recharge so far, you &amp;ldquo;need to do so by 15 April 2017 to avoid degradation and/or discontinuation of services&amp;rdquo;. Those unable to subscribe to Prime until now can &amp;ldquo;continue to do so by paying Rs. 408 or Rs. 608 (Jio Prime + recharge price) to avail these benefits&amp;rdquo;, according to Jio.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://aadhaarcardnews.in/images/jio-benefits-650_650x400_51491977379.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h1 id=&#34;dhan-dhana-dhan-plans&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Dhan Dhana Dhan&amp;rdquo; plans&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rs 309:&lt;/em&gt; Jio&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;all unlimited&amp;rdquo; plan priced at Rs 309 includes 1GB of 4G data, which is high speed internet, per day. Under Dhan Dhana Dhan offer - which is limited to one recharge only - Prime members will get 84 GB for 84 days, as per Jio&amp;rsquo;s website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rs 509:&lt;/em&gt; The Rs 509 plan &amp;ldquo;for daily high data users&amp;rdquo; includes 168 GB of high speed data (2GB per day at 4G speed) for 84 days on the first recharge.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://aadhaarcardnews.in/images/jio-rs-309-rs-509_650x400_81491977322.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Both &lt;em&gt;Rs 309 and Rs 509 plans&lt;/em&gt; include unlimited calling and unlimited SMS. Consumers will get 28 GB of 4G data (1GB per day) and 56 GB of data (2GB per day) for 28 days on subsequent recharges of Rs 309 and Rs 509, respectively, as per the Jio website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;datagiri&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Datagiri&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Jio makes India the highest quality, most affordable data market in the world so that every Indian can do Datagiri,&amp;rdquo; the Jio release noted.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Indian Oil To Revise Petrol, Diesel Prices Daily In 5 Cities From May 1</title>
      <link>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/5-cities-first-petrol-diesel-price-will-change-daily-from-next-month/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 13 Apr 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/5-cities-first-petrol-diesel-price-will-change-daily-from-next-month/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A pilot for daily revision of petrol and diesel price will be first implemented in Puducherry, Vizag in Andhra Pradesh, Udaipur in Rajasthan, Jamshedpur in Jharkhand and Chandigarh.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Come May 1, petrol and diesel prices will change every day in sync with international rates, much like what happens in most advanced markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;State-owned fuel retailers Indian Oil Corp (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL), which own over 95 per cent of nearly 58,000 petrol pumps in the country, will launch a pilot for daily price revision in five select cities from May 1 and gradually extend it to all over the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Ultimately, we will be driving towards market linked rates on a daily basis at all pumps across the country,&amp;rdquo; IOC Chairman B Ashok told PTI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A pilot for daily revision of petrol and diesel price will be first implemented in Puducherry, Vizag in Andhra Pradesh, Udaipur in Rajasthan, Jamshedpur in Jharkhand and Chandigarh, he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;State fuel retailers currently revise rates on 1st and 16th of every month based on average international price of the fuel in the preceding fortnight and currency exchange rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of using fortnightly average, pump rates will reflect daily movement in international oil prices and rupee-US dollar fluctuations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It is technically possible to change rates daily but we have to first do a pilot. Once pilot is done and its implications studied, we will extend it to other parts of the country,&amp;rdquo; he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Ashok said the pilot is to be &amp;ldquo;launched within one month&amp;rdquo; and did not give a specific date, industry sources said the pilot is planned to be launched on May 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daily price change will remove the big leaps in rates that need to be effected at the end of the fortnight and consumer will be more aligned to market dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While petrol price was freed from government control in June 2010, diesel rates were deregulated in October 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technically, oil companies have freedom to revise rates but often they have been guided by political considerations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rates differ by only a few paise between pumps of the three state fuel retailers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unbranded petrol at IOC pumps in Delhi costs Rs 66.29 per litre, while the same at BPCL pumps in the city is priced at Rs 66.37 a litre. HPCL pumps sell for Rs 66.48 per litre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unbranded diesel at IOC pumps in Delhi costs Rs 55.61, Rs 55.66 at BPCL outlets and Rs 55.69 a litre at HPCL pumps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With daily changes, which are unlikely to more than few paise per litre, the political pressures for not revising rates particularly when they are to be hiked will go, sources said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Petrol price was last revised downward by Rs 3.77 a litre on April and diesel rates were cut by Rs 2.91. This was the first revision in two-and-half-months as oil firms did not change prices during assembly elections in five states, including Uttar Pradesh and Punjab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ashok said prices of petrol and diesel in a particular market (city or town) will be the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;By and large, in a particular market it should be same. Though, there might be marginal difference from pump to pump,&amp;rdquo; he said.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Jio Impact: Vodafone Offers Free 4GB Data On SIM Upgrade</title>
      <link>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/jio-impact-vodafone-offers-free-4gb-data-on-sim-upgrade/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 13 Apr 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/jio-impact-vodafone-offers-free-4gb-data-on-sim-upgrade/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Vodafone 4G SIMs are available at all Vodafone Stores, Vodafone Mini Stores or multi brand outlets located across Mumbai,&amp;rdquo; the company said in a statement.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vodafone is offering 4GB data free on upgradation to Vodafone Supernet 4G. Vodafone users in Mumbai who upgrade to a 4G SIM card (with 4G handsets) can avail the free data. &amp;ldquo;Vodafone 4G SIMs are available at all Vodafone Stores, Vodafone Mini Stores or multi brand outlets located across Mumbai,&amp;rdquo; the company said in a statement. The new offer comes a day after the new entrant in telecom sector, Reliance Jio, announced its &amp;lsquo;Dhan Dhana Dhan&amp;rsquo; offer. Jio has started a price war among the operators by offering various discounts, free data and unlimited voice calls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After getting the new 4G SIM, Vodafone prepaid users get 4GB data free for a duration of 10 days. While for postpaid customers, the offer can be availed till their next billing date. &amp;ldquo;The free data shall be added to the customer&amp;rsquo;s data balance on upgrading to a 4G SIM,&amp;rdquo; the statement added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commenting on the development, Pushpinder Singh Gujral, business head-Mumbai, Vodafone India, said, &amp;ldquo;Vodafone is proud to be the preferred telecom services provider to over 9 million customers in Mumbai. We are offering 4GB data free for our customers to experience the benefits of our Data Strong Network and enjoy unparalleled mobile internet services.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s how you can switch to the new 4G SIM:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walk in to any nearest outlet and get your 4G SIM&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;To activate the 4G SIM card, use your existing Vodafone number to SMS &amp;lsquo;SIMEX &lt;your 20 digit new 4G SIM card number&gt;&amp;rsquo; to 55199 (this number will be available on the new SIM card/jacket given to you)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You will receive a response SMS from 55199 with partial SIM number entered&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Send the last 6 digits of the new SIM number to 55199 within 2 hours of receiving the SMS mentioned in the above step&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you receive a success SMS, your 4G SIM will be activated within 20 minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Replace your old SIM in the handset with the new 4G SIM&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case customers face any issues with the SIM upgrade process, they can call 199 or seek assistance from the staff at any Vodafone retail store, the company&amp;rsquo;s statement noted.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Reliance Jio Ahead In Network Coverage But Trails In 4G Speeds: Report</title>
      <link>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/reliance-jio-ahead-in-network-coverage-but-trails-in-4g-speeds-report/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 13 Apr 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/reliance-jio-ahead-in-network-coverage-but-trails-in-4g-speeds-report/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reliance Jio carries 90 per cent plus of all data traffic in the country currently while its network capacity share is closer to 35 per cent, the report said.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reliance Jio network coverage is significantly ahead of the other operators but the newcomer trails Airtel in 4G speeds given the high load on its network during the free offer period, says a report by Credit Suisse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Our conclusion is that Jio&amp;rsquo;s network coverage is significantly ahead of the other operators. Jio has good coverage in 80 per cent plus of cities surveyed, compared to less than 30 per cent for the others. The difference is even more stark when compared only with 4G networks of incumbents (sub-15 per cent of cities),&amp;rdquo; the latest report said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the newcomer did not fare as well when it came to speeds - the survey concluded that Airtel offered the best 4G speeds, while Jio was &amp;ldquo;probably bogged down by load&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We also studied the network speed results across all these locations. Airtel 4G offers the best download speeds in general (12Mbps plus). Jio, Vodafone and Idea are close to each other (7-8Mbps). We suspect Jio&amp;rsquo;s speeds are impacted by the high load on the network in the free offer period,&amp;rdquo; Credit Suisse said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jio carries 90 per cent plus of all data traffic in the country currently while its network capacity share is closer to 35 per cent, it added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The competitive pressure is expected to sustain, the report said adding that significant pressure on fundamentals will continue in coming quarters from Jio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We have already started seeing the impact of Jio on the incumbents&amp;rsquo; numbers (Bharti 3Q).
