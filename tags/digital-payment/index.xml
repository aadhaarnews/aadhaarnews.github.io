&lt;p&gt;The linking of Aadhaar — the 12-digit unique identification number for Indian residents is about to become safer as new rules put the onus on government departments and agencies to safeguard personal data or information held by them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Departments handling the data will have to ensure that end-users are made aware of the data usage and collection and their consent is taken either in writing or electronically, according to new guidelines issued by the government for security of personal data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sensitive personal data such as passwords, financial information (bank account, credit card, debit card and other payment instrument details), medical records and history, sexual orientation, physical and mental health, and biometric information cannot be stored by agencies without encryption, say the guidelines issued by the Ministry of electronics and information technology (IT).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be sure, the Information Technology Act 2000 and Aadhaar Act 2016 have laid down most of these rules. The new guidelines seek answers to questions being asked on data protection under the Aadhaar Act, according to Press Trust of India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;uidai-warns-government-departments&#34;&gt;UIDAI warns government departments:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Publishing identity information, i.e. Aadhaar number along with demographic information is in clear contravention of the provisions of the Aadhaar Act 2016 and constitutes an offence punishable with imprisonment up to 3 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Publishing of financial information including bank details, being sensitive personal data, is also in contravention of provision under IT Act 2000 with violations liable to pay damages by way of compensation to persons affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The move to protect personal data comes after reports that data of 130 million Aadhaar cardholders has been leaked from four government websites. Reports, based on a study conducted by the Centre for Internet and Society (CIS) said Aadhaar numbers and details have been leaked.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>BHIM-Aadhaar App Revamped. Here&#39;s What Is New</title>
      <link>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/bhim-aadhaar-app-revamped-heres-what-is-new/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the latest version of BHIM e-wallet app on Friday, as the government aggressively pursues a &amp;ldquo;less-cash&amp;rdquo; economy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the latest version of BHIM e-wallet app on Friday, as the government aggressively pursues a &amp;ldquo;less-cash&amp;rdquo; economy to combat the problem of black money and digitise the economy. Promoting the latest version BHIM 1.3, on the 126th birth anniversary of Dr Bhimrao R. Ambedkar, PM Modi said that the BHIM-Aadhaar platform would play the same role of empowering the common Indian as the Constitution of India, framed by Dr Ambedkar. To further incentivize Indians to make the switch to using the BHIM app for transacting business, PM Modi also launched two schemes - cash back for merchants and referral bonus for individual owners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here Are Some Of The Key Features Of BHIM:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;BHIM, short for Bharat Interface for Money, enables its users to transfer money using their mobile phone. The app created a world record by registering 10 million downloads in just four months since its launch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the new cashback scheme, the merchants will get a cashback on every transaction using BHIM. For every successful referral, users can earn Rs. 10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;PM Modi declared on Friday that incentives totalling Rs. 495 crore will be given to merchants for accepting payments through BHIM and existing users for referring it to others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around 2 MB in size, the latest version of the app enables payments through a fingerprint scanner by authenticating biometric details of the user against the Aadhaar database.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The app is available in 12 languages with three new languages (Marathi, Punjabi and Assamese) added in BHIM 1.3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The app, now allows users to transfer money to contacts saved on the phone. However, there&amp;rsquo;s a cap of Rs. 10,000 for a single transaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;At present account holders of around 30 banks can transact on BHIM 1.3. The app will add Punjab And Maharashtra Co-Operative Bank Ltd, Punjab &amp;amp; Sind Bank and Jammu and Kashmir Bank soon, according to its Google Play Store page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike the United Payments Interface (UPI), BHIM users do not need to download mobile applications of multiple banks to transact with different banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the government&amp;rsquo;s move on November 8 last year to demonetise Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 currency notes, the number of digital payment apps have logged a nearly 23-fold increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Developed by National Payments Corporation of India, BHIM aims pave the way for making payments using fingerprints or iris scanners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Income Tax Department Reminds On Cash Transaction Limit. Details Here</title>
      <link>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/income-tax-department-reminds-on-cash-transaction-limit-details-here/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Under Section 269ST of the Income Tax Act, accepting cash of Rs 2 lakh or more by any individual is restricted.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an effort to check corruption and a further push towards digital payments, the government has capped the cash transactions at Rs 2 lakh with effective from April 1, 2017. Under Section 269ST of the Income Tax Act, accepting cash of Rs 2 lakh or more by any individual is restricted. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley in his budget speech had proposed the idea of putting a restriction on cash transactions. The government is closely monitoring all large cash and suspicious transactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Act prohibits such cash dealings on a single day, in respect of a single transaction or transactions relating to one event or occasion from an individual. &amp;ldquo;Contravention of Section 269ST would entail levy of 100 per cent penalty on receiver of the amount,&amp;rdquo; the Income Tax department said in a tweet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The restriction is however not applicable to any receipt by government, banking company, post office savings bank or co-operative bank, the tax department added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Post notes ban, the government has also come up with a black money declaration scheme or Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana (PMGKY) under which people holding unaccounted cash could come clean by declaring their wealth and pay 50 per cent as tax and penalty. So far, the PMGKY scheme has not got a &amp;ldquo;good response,&amp;rdquo; the government said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The response (to the PMGKY) has not been so good&amp;hellip;about Rs 5,000 crore of income was declared in PMGKY,&amp;rdquo; Revenue Secretary Hasmukh Adhia said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tax department also advised people to report cash dealings above the permissible limit or any information regarding unaccounted cash by dropping an email to &amp;lsquo;blackmoneyinfo@incometax.gov.in &amp;lsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mobile number will be deactivated if not linked with Aadhaar card</title>

&lt;p&gt;The government had in March 2017, had announced that Aadhaar-based e-KYC (know your customer) will be made mandatory for mobile phone connections. The department of telecommunications (DoT) had then ordered all mobile operators to verify the details of the existing customers by using their unique Aadhaar identity number and biometric details by early 2018. Aadhaar-based e-KYC will also be made compulsory for customers who have to get new SIM cards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Airtel and Idea have begun the process of completing this verification. The two service providers are sending messages to their customers to initiate the KYC process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A message in Airtel store reads: “Link your Aadhaar card to your number now to stay active! As per the Government of India, this is mandatory to enjoy continued services”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To save yourself from getting your services discontinued, here is your guide to link your Aadhaar card with your mobile phone number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How to link the phone number to your Aadhaar card?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• As soon as you receive the SMS, go to the nearby store of your operator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Take your Aadhaar card along and give the details there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• After this, you will receive a 4 digit verification code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Once the code is confirmed, fingerprint verification will be done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Within 24 hours, you will get another message for “Final verify”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Reply to that message with “Y”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• You will get an SMS that your number is linked to the Aadhaar card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;clear-your-doubts-with-these-answers&#34;&gt;Clear your doubts with these answers&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do I need to pay any charges?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This process is free and you need to get it done through an operator’s store only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Can I do online registration?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, don’t go behind any online registration sites, as they are fake. The process is manual and as of now, only offline registration facility is available. Telecom operators haven’t started online registration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;What’s the last date?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last date is 6th of February 2018. Do it as soon as possible as it is rightly said, “Sooner the better”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Can the Aadhaar card be linked to multiple SIM cards?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, you can link it. However, a limit has been set for maximum connections. You need to find it out from your operator store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Follow the instructions mentioned above and get your card linked as soon as possible. It is better to be safe than sorry; following the rule at the earliest will not only benefit you, but will also ensure that you don’t face any issues later on.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SBI&#39;s New Charges On ATM, Other Transactions </title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;ATM transactions from SBIs mobile app &amp;ldquo;Bank Buddy&amp;rdquo; will attract a Rs. 25 charge per transaction.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;HIGHLIGHTS&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cash transactions are capped at Rs 2 lakh with effective from April 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The government is monitoring all large cash and suspicious transactions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any breach of the rule will attract a penalty of 100 per cent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The country’s largest lender State Bank of India has revised service charges on ATM withdrawal for users of its mobile app “SBI Bank Buddy,” and various other cash transactions, effective June 1. SBI has clarified that the Rs. 25 charge will be levied only on withdrawing money from an ATM through its mobile wallet app. SBI’s app Bank Buddy is a new facility that enables withdrawal of cash through ATMs using the bank&amp;rsquo;s mobile wallet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All normal saving bank accounts in a month will continue to get eight free ATM transactions (5 at SBI ATMs + 3 at ATMs of other banks) in metros and 10 free transactions in non-metros (5 at SBI ATMs + 3 at ATMs of other banks), the clarification added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The limit of four ATM withdrawals per month only applies to the Basic Savings Banks Deposit Accounts, SBI further said. SBI’s basic savings account is a limited-services bank account aimed at poorer sections of society to encourage them to start saving without any burden of charges or fees. This type of bank account comes with an ATM-cum-debit free of cost and no annual maintenance charges. A basic savings bank deposit account holder is not eligible to open any other savings bank account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SBI has also revised service charges on various cash transactions for its customers, effective June 1. Here are some of the other key changes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Online Transfers:&lt;/em&gt; Online fund transfer through IMPS or Immediate Payment Service will now be charged Rs. 5 plus service tax for amounts of up to Rs. 1 lakh; Rs. 15 plus service tax for above Rs. 1 lakh and up to Rs. 2 lakh; and Rs. 25 plus service tax for above Rs. 2 lakh and up to Rs. 5 lakh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Exchange of Soiled Notes:&lt;/em&gt; If a customer wishes to exchange of more than 20 soiled notes or if the total value of soiled notes is above Rs. 5,000, SBI said it will charge Rs. 2 plus service charge for every soiled note.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cheque Books:&lt;/em&gt; From June 1, a customer with a Basic Savings Bank Deposit will have to pay Rs. 30 plus service tax for a 10-leaf cheque book, Rs. 75 with service tax for 25-leaf cheque book and Rs. 150 plus service tax for a 50-leaf cheque book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Charges on ATM Cards:&lt;/em&gt; SBI said that issuance of new debit cards will be charged from June 1 and only RuPay classic card will be issued for free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cash Withdrawals:&lt;/em&gt; Customers with a Basic Savings Bank Deposit will get four free withdrawals (including ATM) in a month, after which withdrawals will be charged at Rs. 50 plus service tax at an SBI branch and at Rs. 20 plus service tax at other bank ATMs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Using BHIM App Can Earn You Referral Bonus, Cashback</title>
      <link>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/bhim-app-can-earn-you-referral-bonus-cashback/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 03 Jun 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/bhim-app-can-earn-you-referral-bonus-cashback/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The BHIM-Aadhaar app will pave the way for making digital payments by using the Aadhaar platform.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To push digital payments further, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has announced &amp;lsquo;cashback&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;referral bonus&amp;rsquo; schemes for using BHIM - Bharat Interface for Money - app. PM Modi said for every person you introduce to the BHIM app, you will get a cashback of Rs. 10. &amp;ldquo;If you refer 20 people a day, you can earn Rs. 200,&amp;rdquo; he added. Developed by National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), the Aadhaar-linked BHIM mobile app is based on the Unified Payment Interface (UPI). In December last year, PM Modi had launched the app for facilitating electronic payments by consumers. In March, the government launched Aadhaar Pay, a new Android-based smartphone app. The BHIM-Aadhaar app will pave the way for making digital payments by using the Aadhaar platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quoting PM Modi NITI Aayog tweeted that &amp;ldquo;just by helping more people use BHIM app, India will receive cashback and referral Bonus.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How to earn the referral bonus:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &amp;lsquo;referral bonus scheme&amp;rsquo;, which is for individuals, is meant to get more people on the BHIM platform and asking them to do transactions with others using BHIM or by referring new users on it. The bonus will be paid to both the existing and new users of BHIM. The referral will only be considered successful after three unique successful financial transactions by the new user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After three unique successful transactions with a minimum limit of Rs. 50 to any three unique users (either to customers or to merchants), the existing and the new user will be notified about the bonus amount via notification in BHIM app. The existing user will get Rs. 10 per successful referral, while the new user will get Rs. 25 for downloading and transacting from the app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the &amp;lsquo;cashback scheme&amp;rsquo;, which is only for merchants, users can earn up to &lt;em&gt;Rs. 300 per month.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Your Face Or Fingerprint Could Soon Replace Your Ticket</title>
      <link>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/your-face-or-fingerprint-could-soon-replace-your-plane-ticket/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 03 Jun 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/your-face-or-fingerprint-could-soon-replace-your-plane-ticket/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The first phase of Delta&amp;rsquo;s program will allow its elite-tier passengers to use their fingerprints, rather than their boarding passes, to enter member lounges.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may soon be able to ditch your boarding pass in favor of your fingers or face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, Delta announced a new biometric identification pilot program that will eventually let you use your fingerprints instead of a plane ticket. That followed a JetBlue announcement hours earlier that it is testing a program in Boston that will match pictures of customers&amp;rsquo; faces with the passport database maintained by U.S. Custom and Border Protections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Delta&amp;rsquo;s program, which kicked off at D.C.&amp;rsquo;s Reagan National Airport, is in partnership with Clear, a company that already lets customers skip to the front of security lines without identification. To be eligible for the program, one must be a member of Delta&amp;rsquo;s frequent flyer SkyMiles program and a Clear subscriber.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first phase of Delta&amp;rsquo;s program will allow its elite-tier passengers to use their fingerprints, rather than their boarding passes, to enter member lounges. A planned second phase would allow Delta frequent flyers to use their fingerprint in lieu of a boarding pass. Per its privacy policy, which will cover the Delta program, Clear keeps users&amp;rsquo; biometric information for the term of their subscriptions. Users can ask for their information to be removed from the company&amp;rsquo;s servers and close their accounts at any time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The airline has also announced it will use facial recognition technology for bag drops, with a pilot testing program at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport in the summer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JetBlue&amp;rsquo;s program works in concert with two entities: the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and a tech firm called SITA. Flyers at Boston&amp;rsquo;s Logan International Airport and Aruba&amp;rsquo;s Queen Beatrix International Airport will have the option of going into the normal boarding line, or one with a camera that will snap their picture. SITA will send that photo to the CBP, to match it against the agency&amp;rsquo;s database of passport and visa photos. The match process is instant, JetBlue said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neither JetBlue nor SITA has access to the photo database, and the airline will not store users&amp;rsquo; biometric information, JetBlue confirmed in an email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the facial scan fails to work, passengers will be moved to the traditional line - so don&amp;rsquo;t travel without your ID just yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using biometric data for identification may sound convenient, but people should consider some things before signing up, said Jeramie Scott, national security counsel for the Electronic Privacy Information Center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neither company has released details on how the government may use information on when and where people&amp;rsquo;s faces have been scanned, he said, nor are there laws to prevent the government from using these types of programs as part of larger surveillance plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s a technology that can easily be used for mass, indiscriminate surveillance,&amp;rdquo; he said, of facial recognition technology. &amp;ldquo;Any use for facial recognition for something like this - where it&amp;rsquo;s the government or companies running a facial recognition search on people - needs to be scrutinized very closely by the public, because of the serious risk of mission creep.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. Customs and Border Protection did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation or IRCTC has decided to make booking tickets a hassle-free affair by providing a &amp;lsquo;buy tickets now and pay later&amp;rsquo; service for regular travelers. Soon passengers would be able to buy tickets from the IRCTC website and pay later, an IRCTC official told Indo-Asian News Service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Potential passengers can book a ticket five days prior to the journey with a service charge of 3.5 per cent and pay it in the next 14 days, IRCTC spokesperson Sandip Dutta said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IRCTC has collaborated with a Mumbai-based firm ePayLater for adding the new service option. The ePayLater platform allows persons to log out immediately after booking tickets and make payments later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The railway agency had earlier introduced &amp;lsquo;pay on delivery&amp;rsquo; category for train tickets booked using its website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to be applicable for new &amp;ldquo;Buy Now Pay Later&amp;rdquo; feature, users will have fill in basic details including Aadhaar and PAN card details after which they will be able to use the feature with a One Time Password (OTP), ePayLater said.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;NPS subscribers have the facility to add their Aadhaar numbers online.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NPS or National Pension Scheme subscribers have been advised to add Aadhaar number to their accounts. Aadhaar is a 12-digit number issued by Unique Identification Authority of India or UIDAI based on the demographic and biometric information of the person. NPS subscribers can add their Aadhaar numbers online. The Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA), the body which manages NPS, been taking a number of measures to simplify the processes. For example, the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority has done away with the requirement of submission of a physical application form for opening of an NPS account if done through Aadhaar verification and e-signature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How to add Aadhaar to your NPS account online:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Log-in to your NPS account (www.cra-nsdl.com)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) Click on &amp;ldquo;Update Details&amp;rdquo; tab and then select the option &amp;ldquo;Add/Update Aadhaar Number&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) Submit your Aadhaar number&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) Enter the OTP received from UIDAI on your registered mobile number&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5) After authentication through OTP, Aadhaar will be linked to your PRAN&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(PRAN or Permanent Retirement Account Number is a unique number allotted to NPS subscribers that remains the same for the rest of subscriber&amp;rsquo;s life)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NPS body has said that a subscriber is required to seed the Aadhaar in his or her PRAN through this process even if Aadhaar was provided earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: PFRDA has said that the name registered against your PRAN should exactly match the name as registered with &amp;ldquo;UIDAI&amp;rdquo; in Aadhaar. If the correction is required on PRAN card, then the NPS subscriber has to submit a self-attested PRAN card copy and a self-attested Aadhaar card copy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For government subscribers, the Aadhaar seeding process will be completed once the request initiated by a subscriber is authorised online by his /her respective Nodal Office, PFRDA said.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>WhatsApp scam alert! how to be safe</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A WhatsApp scam is going viral all around the world where users could be tricked into paying a fake subscription fee. WhatsApp users are being targeted by a fake message which falsely claims their current &amp;lsquo;subscription&amp;rsquo; has expired.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A WhatsApp scam is going viral all around the world where users could be tricked into paying a fake subscription fee. WhatsApp users are being targeted by a fake message which falsely claims their current ‘subscription’ has expired. It encourages the users to tap on a weird link. While WhatsApp is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a hugely popular messaging app with more than a billion global users, it also is a prime target for malware and scammers. The new malicious link has been telling WhatsApp users that their ‘subscription has expired’. This message is being circulated all around WhatsApp. Additionally, the message asks its users for a verification of their accounts. It also asks the users to buy a lifetime subscription for 0.99 British pounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that WhatsApp is a free messaging service, and it does not charge its users at all. There was a time, long back, when it used to charge a small annual amount from its users, but now it does not. The link which is going viral is essentially a scam and you should refrain from clicking on it. If you click on the malicious link, it might give access of your personal data including your bank details to hackers. The fake WhatsApp message reads as: “Your subscription has expired. To verify your account and purchase a lifetime subscription for just 0.99 GBP simply tap on this link.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, several users have taken to Twitter where they are warning others about the new scam. You have been advised to delete the message immediately, if you get it, and also block the sender. In order to block a contact which is not saved to your device, open the WhatsApp conversation and click on ‘Block’. Users may also report the user under ‘Spam’ category. In case you received the fake message from one of your contacts, you can block them too, by clicking on the menu button present on the WhatsApp home screen. Just select Settings, Go to Account, Go to Privacy, Select ‘Blocked contacts’. Then add that contact to your Blocked list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users who have already clicked on the link can safeguard themselves by running an antivirus software on their smartphones to make sure they are not infected with malware.
There have been many such instances where hackers have made use of WhatsApp to circulate dangerous links. Earlier, a spam message was circulated on the messaging app, where it invited users to a WhatsApp Gold version, an invite-only club with special features where they could be able to meet movie stars. There have been cases where links were circulated inviting users to download video-calling. These messages also claimed that PM Narendra Modi wanted to give everyone in India, ‘Rs 500 balance’ free for their mobile phones.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Aadhaar Card Mandatory for Joining a Company</title>
      <link>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/aadhaar-card-mandatory-joining-companys-board/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The government has made the biometric authentication using Aadhaar mandatory after facing several scenarios of fake identity theft—including becoming a director on a board of the company or for issuing its returns by company secretaries and chartered accountants—for Companies Act-related transactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As per the sources, the Ministry Of Corporate Affairs has encountered several instances where people have established a Director Identification Number or have been chosen as directors on boards of the company without their consent, a necessity for connecting a board, as their signatures were copied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consequently, in the near future, anyone looking for a Director Identification Number will have to authenticate using biometric devices and fill up the online form that can soon be connected to PCs. In the same way, anyone chosen by the banks or government and financial institutions on boards of the company will have to provide biometric authentication. A parallel setup for company secretaries and CAs is also being operated out, confirmed the source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A squad from Infosys has been assigned with placing in the new machine that will be introduced in stages, initiating with the allocation of Director Identification Number. Progressively over a period of couple of years, it will be extended to involve all work related to MCA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will be exclusions for non-residents and others, who are not qualified to get Aadhaar such as those people whose iris or fingerprints are not able to capture. MCA considers that the projected system does not encounter any issues since the recent order of the Supreme Court on Aadhaar as the system was destined for authentication. According to sources, the Supreme court had itself recommended that mobile connections be confirmed using Aadhaar and tax department as well as the banks have also been permitted to use the distinctive identification number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From 2017, the income tax department has also made Aadhaar compulsory for issuing permanent account numbers since it targets individuals using numerous PANs, which is not legal, to avoid from taxes. Though this move was disapproved, the government thinks that employment of UID can aid in enhancing compliance across various sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jio is offering a variety of recharge options to members of its paid Prime service. Jio, or Reliance Jio Infocomm, the telecom arm of billionaire Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries, has also launched benefits like multi-fold data and validity under &amp;ldquo;all unlimited three months&amp;rdquo; schemes on first recharges of Rs 309 and Rs 509. Jio last week announced &amp;ldquo;all unlimited plans with special benefits&amp;rdquo; priced at Rs 309 and Rs 509, putting an end to complimentary service plans under its Summer Surprise offer on telecom regulator TRAI&amp;rsquo;s advice. Jio&amp;rsquo;s Prime service offers &amp;ldquo;truly free&amp;rdquo; voice, &amp;ldquo;no charge towards voice or the data used to make 4G voice calls&amp;rdquo;, it said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides free calls - local, STD and roaming - to all networks, Jio&amp;rsquo;s Rs 149 plan includes 2GB of 4G data and comes with a validity of 28 days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;rs-309-recharge&#34;&gt;Rs 309 Recharge&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jio&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;most affordable&amp;rdquo; Rs 309 recharge, which comes with the first recharge benefit - wherein Jio users making their first recharge of Rs 309 get 1GB data per day for a period of 84 days, instead of 28 days. At subsequent recharges of Rs 309, Jio users get 1GB of 4G data per day for 28 days.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Go for PM’s insurance schemes on June 1</title>
      <link>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/pms-insurance-schemes-on-june-1/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana (PMJJBY) and Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana (PMSBY) were launched by Prime Minister Modi in May 2015 to provide affordable universal access to essential social security protection in a convenient manner.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You must have heard about the Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana (PMJJBY) and the Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana (PMSBY), which were launched by Prime Minister Modi in May 2015 to provide affordable universal access to essential social security protection in a convenient manner. While the first is a life insurance scheme, the other is an accidental cover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have already enrolled yourself under these schemes and want the cover to continue, then the premium will be auto debited from your account on June 1. You might also have received an SMS from your bank in this respect. However, if you have still not done this and want to go for the schemes, then you can enrol for these schemes on June 1 to get their full benefit as the schemes provide coverage for one-year period from June 1 to May 31. You can go for these schemes anytime during the year, but will have to pay the same premium. So, why to delay? Why not to get enrolled from Day 1?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s how these schemes work:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana (PMJJBY):&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana is a one-year life insurance scheme, which is annually renewable. The scheme provides coverage of Rs 2 lakh for death owing to any reason and is offered to all saving bank account holders in the age group of 18 to 50 years at the annual premium of only Rs 330.
The date of commencement of insurance cover under this scheme is the date of debit of premium from the insured member’s account for joining the scheme and the insurance cover is provided up to May 31 of the subsequent year. However, the risk is not covered for new members during the first 45 days from the date of enrollment into the scheme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cover is automatically renewed on June 1 of every year by debiting the premium from the member’s bank account. In case anyone wishes to join the scheme thereafter, one can do so by paying the full year’s premium and submitting the requisite documents.
According to the information provided by the government, as on April 12, 2017, Cumulative Gross enrolment reported by banks subject to verification of eligibility, etc. was about 3.1 crore under PMJJBY. A total of 63291 claims were registered under this scheme, of which 59770 have been disbursed.
Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana (PMSBY)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana is a one-year accident insurance, which can be renewed annually. Under this scheme, accidental death and full disability cover of Rs 2 lakh and partial disability cover of Rs 1 lakh is offered on account of an accident to all saving bank account holders in the age group of 18 to 70 years for a premium of Rs 12 per annum. If you subscribe for this scheme, then the premium will directly auto-debited by the bank from your account.
As on April 12, 2017, cumulative gross enrolment reported by banks subject to verification of eligibility, etc. was about 10 crore under PMSBY. A total of 12816 claims were registered under PMSBY, of which 9646 have been disbursed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Govt makes Aadhaar mandatory for students</title>
      <link>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/aadhaar-mandatory-students/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The move is aimed at checking the drop-out rate and ensuring quality education&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Yogi Adityanath government in Uttar Pradesh has made Aadhaar Card mandatory for students from Class 1 to 8 in government schools. The Basic Education department has been entrusted with this task involving over 1.75 crore students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Basic Education Minister Anupama Jaiswal said that directions have been issued in this regard. “The main aim of the government is to link their Aadhaar Card number with different welfare schemes, including mid-day meal, run by the state for the welfare of primary students,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Aadhaar will also help the basic education department to keep a tab on their attendance as well as their performance. “This will certainly help the government to check the drop-out rate and ensure quality education to primary students,” said the minister after holding review meeting of the department.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Yogi government has also decided to replace Khakhi dress of primary students with vibrant pink shirt and blue pants for boys, and pink kurti and blue pyjama for girls. The new dress code would be effective this session from July. Orders have already been placed for the distribution of free dress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, it was CM Adityanath who had raised an objection on school dress in the state saying that students look more like policemen. He had ordered for selection of new dress as per choices of students and parents. After taking opinion from them, the basic education department finally selected the new dress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Basic Education department has also decided to form a six-member committee of mothers in over 1.25 lahh primary schools in the state. Known as ‘Maa’, the committee would randomly check the quality of food being served in mid-day meal. Each primary school will have separate committee to ensure quality food to students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has also issued directives to bring every child to schools and ensure distribution of free school bags, shoes, and text book by July first week&lt;/p&gt;
