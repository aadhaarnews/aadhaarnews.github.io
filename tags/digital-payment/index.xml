      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Over 18 lakh cattle will be given Aadhaar-like UID numbers in a year that will prevent their illegal transportation and help improve their health and milk yield, officials said.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jharkhand has tagged over 12,000 cows with Aadhaar-like 12-digit unique identification (UID) number to prevent illegal transportation of cattle, improve their milk yield and monitor their health, officials said, amid a nationwide debate on cow vigilantism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Centre told the Supreme Court on Monday that it will soon approve tamper-proof identity tags for all cattle in the country that will document a range of data, including a unique number and the type of their horn and tail, as part of efforts to prevent illegal transportation of cattle and livestock to Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jharkhand State Implement Agency for Cattle and Buffalo (JSIACB), a wing of the government of India, has been working on a pilot project to tag its cattle with Aadhaar-like details in eight districts — Ranchi, Hazaribagh, Dhanbad, Bokaro, Jamshedpur, Deoghar, Giridih and Lohardaga — much before the Centre’s proposal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pilot project is being carried under the Centre’s INAPH (information network for animal productivity and health) scheme for the last one year in Jharkhand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The information will be uploaded on the master data within a week,” INAPH’s Jharkhand nodal in-charge KK Tiwary said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

Tiwary said each animal has been tagged with 12-digit UID numbers, which is fixed around its ears, with records of identification details such as age, breed, sex, lactation, height, body, colour, horn type, tail switch, special mark and others. In Jharkhand, there is around 42 lakh head of cattle, and 70% of them are cows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Centre has recently directed us to extend the programme to all 24 districts and tag at least 18 lakh cattle in a year,” Tiwary said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JSIACB chief executive officer Dr Govind Prasad said tracking of the breeding programme is one of the aims of the project. He said the unique ID would also help Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, constituted in each district of Jharkhand, to monitor and check illegal trade of cattle in their respective districts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a bid to check illegal trade of cattle and their slaughtering, the Jharkhand government issued an order on March 27 for the closure of all illegal slaughterhouses across the state. The state administration has closed more than 1,000 illegal slaughterhouses so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jharkhand is one of the few states in the country where the Prevention of Cow Slaughter Act, 2005, is in place. The act imposes a penalty of Rs 5,000 and imprisonment of up to 5 years or both for offenders. However, despite the law, cow slaughter continues unabated in the several illegal slaughter houses across many districts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prasad said after compilation of the information to the database, details of each animal could be accessed anywhere and anytime. “The animal details could also be tracked through smartphones,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Focus on cow protection, especially by vigilante groups, has risen since the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government under Prime Minister Narendra Modi took power at the Centre 3 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has been a string of cow-related violence but many state governments, particularly those ruled by the BJP, have defended the action on the grounds that the animal is considered holy by many Hindus.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Aadhaar eKYC mandatory for mobile connections: Here’s how it applies to you</title>
      <link>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/aadhaar-ekyc-mandatory-mobile-connections-heres-applies/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 26 Apr 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/aadhaar-ekyc-mandatory-mobile-connections-heres-applies/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you don’t have an Aadhaar card number, you’ll probably have to get one soon, since the government is making this mandatory across a range of services, and it looks like getting a mobile connection is next on the list. Last Friday, Department of Telecom (DoT) has issued an order asking telecom operators to start the process of re-verifying their subscribers with Aadhaar-based eKYC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DoT’s order reads, “All licensees shall re-verify all existing mobile subscribers (prepaid and postpaid) through Aadhaar-based e-KYC process.”  For telecom providers, the DoT is giving a one year time period to carry out this eKYC process; the order puts the final date at February 6, 2018. The DoT directive comes after the Supreme Court issued an order with this respect in February this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what is Aadhaar-based eKYC and what does it require? For starters, the Aadhaar card becomes mandatory if you to hold onto your old mobile number or even get a new one. Aadhaar eKYC is a paperless form of Know Your Customer (KYC); the KYC guidelines ensure that the service provider, and this is not just restricted to mobile service providers, but includes banks, etc, need to have details of their customers like address, age, full name, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Aadhaar-based KYC  identity, address and other details are verified via the Aadhaar authentication online. A user will have to give his Aadhaar number, do the biometric verification, and the KYC is done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how will you know when to get eKYC done with your mobile operator? No need to rush just yet, but this will come soon. Customers will start receiving SMS alerts, or see television and print ads from their telecom provider regarding the same as DoT has directed them to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cellular operators’ association of India (COAI) had said that its members, which includes the majority of telecom providers in the country, will meet later this week to discuss the process. However COAI has pointed out the entire exercise will cost Rs 1,000 crore for infrastructure and training, which will have to be borne by the operators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The issue of fake subscribers will go away. We will try our best to cover the entire base within the stipulated time frame of one year but in case we cannot, we may ask DoT for an extension,” COAI Director General Rajan Mathews said in a statement to PTI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will one eKYC be good enough to get another connection with the same operator? No, if you go by the DoT notification. According to a PTI report, “For issuing additional mobile connections to re-verified subscriber, the operator would have to follow a separate eKYC process.” So if you have a Vodafone or Airtel connection, and you get it re-verified, getting a second number will require another eKYC, which is tedious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if you are converting prepaid to postpaid or vice versa, then you won’t be requiring another eKYC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons for Aadhaar-based eKYC is that it will help deal with the issue of fake mobile subscribers in the country. But the catch is that it also means that anyone who doesn’t have an Aadhaar card won’t be able to continue with the mobile connection, which sounds extreme. India has over 1 billion plus mobile connections, and this Aadhaar eKYC will impact every single user.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Banks Fixed Deposit Rates Lowest In Many Years. What Are Your Options?</title>
      <link>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/bank-fixed-deposit-rates-are-at-multi-year/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 26 Apr 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/bank-fixed-deposit-rates-are-at-multi-year/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today the interest rates on bank fixed deposits are at multi-year lows. For example, State Bank of India is offering interest rate between 5.50 per cent and 6.90 per cent across different maturities on retail deposits (below Rs 1 crore), according to its website. Though the Reserve Bank of India has held its repo rate steady for some time, the 175-basis-point cut in its key lending rate since January 2015 has led to a broad decline in overall interest rate in the financial system. And the surge in deposits after demonetisation has forced banks to bring down interest rates on fixed deposits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;With bank fixed deposits at around 7 per cent and offering a post-tax return of 5-7 per cent depending on one&amp;rsquo;s tax slab, clearly for people in higher tax slab this will only help them match inflation and be at best a value protector,&amp;rdquo; says Manoj Nagpal, CEO, Outlook Asia Capital. But conservative investors should maintain their asset allocation based on their risk profile, he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some newer private banks offer higher rates, Mr Nagpal added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Given that most asset classes that replace debt like gold, real estate etc have also not been giving returns in the short term, equity seems to be emerging as the only alternative. However investors should not over-allocate to equities just in the chase of higher returns. If being safe is the objective, then one should surely remember that equities are volatile by nature,&amp;rdquo; he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He says small savings schemes like 5-year NSC (National Savings Certificates) offer a superior alternative for investors though with a slightly longer lock-in and could also be considered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For senior citizens, Mr Nagpal recommends the Senior Citizen Savings Scheme and the to-be-launched Varishtha Pension Bima Yojana from LIC. The Varishtha Pension Bima Yojana 2017 is a pension scheme for senior citizens, which was earlier approved by the Union Cabinet. The Varishtha Pension Bima scheme 2017, which will be implemented through Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), assures pension based on a guaranteed rate of return of 8 per cent for 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among debt mutual funds, Mr Nagpal suggests accrual funds with a high quality of underlying portfolio for conservative investors. Given that the Reserve Bank of India has once again cautioned on the higher risks to inflation, conservative investors should reduce allocation to long duration debt funds, he added. Accrual funds mainly focus on earning interest income from the coupon offered by underlying bonds while debt funds based on duration try to gain from the upward or downward movement of interest rate in the economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vidya Bala, head of mutual fund research at Fundsindia.com, also says conservative investors should &amp;ldquo;actively considerer income accrual funds in mutual funds.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If investors have a shorter time frame, Ms Bala suggests short-term and ultra short-term debt funds. &amp;ldquo;If they need regular income, they can use systematic withdrawal from short-term debt funds,&amp;rdquo; she adds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Besides generating superior returns, debt funds are more tax efficient&amp;rdquo; than bank fixed deposits, she says.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>From Vodafone To Airtel To BSNL, Operators Launch New Plans To Take On Jio</title>

&lt;p&gt;With tariff war intensifying in Indian telecom sector after Reliance Jio&amp;rsquo;s low cost data plans under its Summer Surprise and Dhan Dhana Dhan offers, prices of mobile data from other incumbent telecom players like Bharti Airtel, Vodafone, Idea Cellular and BSNL have fallen by nearly 60 per cent. According to domestic research house Crisil, the telecom player which will be able to retain maximum average revenue per user (ARPU) will win the ongoing tariff war and be able to sustain. In a bid to retain existing customers, incumbent telecom players like Airtel, Vodafone, Idea and BSNL are pricing their plans in such a way that they retain maximum of their existing subscribers and also maintain their ARPU. Here&amp;rsquo;s a look at various plans launched by incumbent telecom players:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reliance Jio Dhan Dhana Dhan offer&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the Dhan Dhana Dhan offer, Reliance Jio is offering 1GB of 4G data per day till end of June on a recharge of Rs 309.

If you exhaust the free minutes, Rs 0.10 per minute will be charged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Airtel Rs 345 recharge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Airtel is offering 2GB of data per day at 4G speed for 28 days under its new Rs 345 recharge pack. Also, now there is no restriction with regard to the timing of data consumption. Under the earlier Rs. 345 recharge pack, users were restricted to use only 500 MB of data daily from 6 am till midnight , and the remaining 500 MB between 12 am and 6 am. Along with the above data, users will also get free voice calls to Airtel and other networks as it is in the Rs. 399 pack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Airtel Rs. 244 recharge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the Rs. 244 recharge, users will get 1 GB of 4G data per day for 70 days without any restriction on usage timing. But this pack offers free calls on Airtel networks only (300 minutes of daily Airtel-to-Airtel calling and 1,200 minutes for a week for 70 days).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vodafone Rs. 352 recharge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under its Rs. 352 recharge pack, Vodafone offers 1GB of data per day for 56 days along with unlimited local and STD calls with a capping of 300 minutes in a day and 1,200 minutes in a week.

You can check if the offer is available for you by dialing *121# from your Vodafone number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;BSNL Rs. 333 plan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BSNL&amp;rsquo;s Triple ACE STV or special tariff voucher priced at Rs. 333 offers 3 GB of 3G data per day for 90 days. After you exhaust the daily data limit of 3GB data, speed will be reduced to 80 Kbps.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>NITI&#39;s 3-Year Agenda Suggests Key Reforms To Bolster Economy</title>
      <link>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/nitis-3-year-agenda-suggests-key-reforms-to-bolster-economy/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 26 Apr 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/nitis-3-year-agenda-suggests-key-reforms-to-bolster-economy/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The draft agenda, released by Niti Aayog Vice Chairman Arvind Panagariya, also underlined the need for recalibrating the role of the government by limiting its involvement in activities that do not serve a public purpose.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Niti Aayog in its three-year draft action agenda today suggested a host of reforms in taxation, agriculture and energy sectors with the objective of accelerating growth and increasing employment opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The draft agenda, released by Niti Aayog Vice Chairman Arvind Panagariya today, also underlined the need for recalibrating the role of the government by limiting its involvement in activities that do not serve a public purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among other things, the Aayog has also suggested the closure of loss-making CPSEs and strategic disinvestment in 20 state-owned companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The three-year agenda (2017-18 to 2019-20) called for steps to check tax evasion, expand tax base and simplify taxation system through reforms. It suggested the government could consider consolidating existing custom duty rates to a unified rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other suggestions include creation of an institutional mechanism to promote competition through comprehensive review and reform of government regulations across all sectors, besides strengthening of the public procurement system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stressing the need to bring down land prices to make housing affordable through increased supply of urban land, it suggested the need of reform in the Rent Control Act along the lines of the Model Tenancy Act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other suggestions include, more flexible conversion rules from one use to another, release of land held by sick units, release of other urban land potentially available and more generous floor space index.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also recommended setting up of dormitory housing for migrants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The draft action agenda on the agriculture sector, which seeks to double the income of farmers by 2022, include reform of the Agriculture Produce Marketing to ensure that farmers receive remunerative prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Aayog&amp;rsquo;s three-year agenda also suggested raising productivity through enhanced irrigation, faster seed replacement and precision agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The farmers, it said, should be encouraged to shift to high-value commodities like horticulture, animal husbandry and fisheries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With regard to the energy sector, the draft agenda pitched for adopting consumer friendly measures such as provision of electricity to all households by 2022, LPG connection to all BPL households, elimination of black carbon by 2022 and extension of the city gas distribution programme to 100 smart cities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also suggested to reduce the cross-subsidy in the power sector to ensure competitive supply of electricity to the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The draft agenda also talked about reforming the coal sector by setting up a regulator, encouraging commercial mining and improving labour productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With regard to transport and digital connectivity, the draft action agenda suggested strengthening infrastructure in roadways, railways, shipping and ports, inland waterways and civil aviation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also pitched for ensuring last-mile digital connectivity, particularly for e-governance and financial inclusion, through developing infrastructure, simplifying the payments structure and improving literacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facilitate public-private partnerships, it said, by reorienting the role of the India Infrastructure Finance Company Ltd (IIFCL) and added there is a need to &amp;ldquo;introduce low cost debt instruments and operationalise the National Investment Infrastructure Fund (NIIF)&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Referring to job creation, the draft agenda sought creation of coastal employment zones to boost exports and generating high-productivity jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also emphasised on enhancing labour-market flexibility through reforms of key laws and addressing the high and rising share of non-performing assets (NPAs) in India&amp;rsquo;s bank through supporting action of larger assets to private reconstruction companies (ARCs) and strengthening the State Bank of India-led by ARC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Science and Technology, it suggested creating a &amp;lsquo;National Science, Technology &amp;amp; Innovation Foundation&amp;rsquo; to identify and deliberate national issues, recommend priority interventions in S&amp;amp;T and prepare frameworks for their implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also suggested developing guidelines for PPPs in S&amp;amp;T to improve education and industry-academia linkages for demand-driven research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The draft agenda also stressed for streamlining the administration of the patent regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The agenda also pitched for enhanced focus on public health through significantly increasing government expenditure on it and suggested establishing a focal point and setting up a dedicated cadre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a need to generate and disseminate periodic, district-level data as per uniform protocols, the draft agenda said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also suggested launching the National Nutrition Mission and developing a comprehensive Nutrition Information System.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The draft agenda also suggested to revisit the policy towards felling of trees on private land and transport of trees.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Operation Clean Money 60,000 individuals including 1,300 ‘high-risk’ cases </title>
      <link>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/operation-clean-money-phase-ii-60k-individuals-including-1300-high/</link>

      <guid>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/operation-clean-money-phase-ii-60k-individuals-including-1300-high/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over 60,000 individuals, including 1,300 high-risk persons, will be under the scanner of the income tax department in the second phase of ‘Operation Clean Money’. The second phase of the black money detection programme, which was first started by the tax department post demonetisation, will investigate into claims of excessive cash sales during the demonetisation that did not match the previous profiles of the tax assessees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“More than 60,000 persons, including 1,300 high-risk persons, have been identified for investigation into claims of excessive cash sales during the demonetisation period. More than 6,000 transactions of high value property purchase and 6,600 cases of outward remittances shall be subjected to detailed investigations. All the cases where no response is received shall also be subjected to detailed enquiries,” the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) said in a statement.
The tax department has identified the high risk persons through detailed investigations using advanced data analytics, including integration of data sources, relationship clustering and fund tracking, CBDT said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The high risk categories identified include businesses claiming cash sales as the source of cash deposits that has been found to be in excess of their past profile or industry norms, large cash deposits made by government or PSU employees, persons who have undertaken high value purchases, persons who have used shell entities for layering of funds and where no responses were received, it said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CBDT, the policy-making body of the department, said it has detected undisclosed income over Rs 9,334 crore between the period of November 9, 2016 till February 28 this year. On November 8 last year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced the decision to scrap high-denomination currency notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the first phase of the ‘Operation Clean Money’, launched on January 31 this year, the department had sent communications to around 18 lakh individuals asking them to respond online to specific queries relating to cash deposits made during November 9-December 30, the time period given for deposit of scrapped currency notes in banks. Out of the 17.92 lakh persons to whom the queries were sent by the tax department under the first phase of operation Clean Money, 9.46 lakh persons responded have responded to the department as per pre-defined parameters of sources of the cash deposits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Online queries were raised in 35000 cases and on-line verification was completed in more than 7800 cases. It has been decided to close the verification in cases where explanation of source of cash was found to be justified. In cases where the cash deposit has been declared under Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojna (PMGKY), the verifications would also be closed,” the tax department said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The post-demonetisation period saw a rise in number of searches and surveys conducted by the tax department. More than 2,362 search, seizure and survey actions were conducted by the tax department during November 9 last year to February 28, leading to seizure of valuables worth more than Rs 818 crore, which includes cash of Rs 622 crore and detection of undisclosed income of more than Rs 9,334 crore. Over 400 cases have been referred by the tax department to the Enforcement Directorate and the CBI. Surveys have been conducted in more than 3400 cases by assessment units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tax department had also launched a compliance window for assesees to come clean with their undisclosed cash and deposits made after demonetisation through the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana (PMGKY). The three-month long PMGKY scheme received lukewarm response, with only Rs 2,300 crore flowing into government coffers as taxes and penalty by declarants in the scheme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rs 9,334 cr undisclosed income detected&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The CBDT said it has detected undisclosed income over Rs 9,334 crore between the period of November 9, 2016 till February 28 this year&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High risk categories include businesses claiming cash sales as the source of cash deposits found to be in excess of their past profile&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Provident Fund Rules Changed. Now, Pay Home Loan EMIs, Buy House From Deposits</title>
      <link>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/provident-fund-rules-changed-pay-home-loan-emis-buy-house-from/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 26 Apr 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/provident-fund-rules-changed-pay-home-loan-emis-buy-house-from/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;EPFO subscribes will be able withdraw up to 90% of their accumulations in their provident fund accounts for purchase/construction of houses or purchase of land.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government has amended the rules of the Employees&amp;rsquo; Provident Funds Scheme to enable over four crore subscribers to pay equated monthly instalments (EMIs) of home loans. They can also make payments towards purchase/construction of houses or purchase of land. This is part of the government&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;Housing for All&amp;rsquo; agenda. The Employees&amp;rsquo; Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) is the retirement fund body that manages provident fund savings on behalf of employees. The government also recently announced other measures like Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban) for middle-income groups to boost the housing sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are 10 things to know:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) EPFO subscribes will be able withdraw up to 90 per cent of their accumulations in their provident fund accounts for purchase/construction of houses or purchase of land. (Also read: 8.65% interest on PF deposits to be credited soon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) To purchase a house under this new scheme, the subscriber has to be a member of a cooperative society or a society registered for housing purpose and such society should have at least ten members. The subscriber can also purchase the flat/house or land from the government or any agency under housing scheme or any promoter or builder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) The retirement fund body will make the payment for purchase of the property to the housing agency - not to the provident fund subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier, only those EPFO subscribers who had completed five years of service were allowed to withdraw provident fund savings for purchase of house/flat/construction including land. They were allowed to withdraw only 36 months of their salary (basic salary and dearness allowance) for this purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) The new rules also provide that that monthly instalments towards home purchase can also be paid from provident fund deposits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5) The monthly instalments will be directly paid to to the government, housing agency, primary lending agency or the bank concerned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6) The subscriber has to apply to the EPFO for availing the new scheme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7) The withdrawal facility from the provident fund account will be available to only those members who fulfil certain conditions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8) The member should have contributed to the fund for at least three years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;9) The facility will be available only once to every member during his or her lifetime. The rule applies to all those who together with their subscriber spouse have at least Rs 20,000 in their accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;10) If the member fails to get allotted a flat or in the event of the cancellation of an allotment, the amount so withdrawn has to be refunded in one lump sum within a period not exceeding fifteen days from the date of such cancellation or non-allotment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SBI Minimum Balance: How Much Fine You Have To Pay</title>
      <link>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/sbi-minimum-balance-how-much-fine-you-have-to-pay/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;SBI or State Bank of India is charging a fine on savings bank account customers not meeting the average monthly balance requirement. The amount of penalty for non-compliance with monthly average balance or MAB requirement is based on customer location - such as metro, urban, semi-urban and rural.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was said by India&amp;rsquo;s largest bank SBI on Twitter while specifying various ranges according to which it will levy the charges. Charges levied for not maintaining the minimum balance depend upon how much the average balance in the account is below the agreed minimum, said SBI, which has&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;introduced minimum balance requirement in savings accounts from April 1. SBI also unveiled a new identity after merging its operations with six other banks recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What is minimum balance requirement?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SBI savings bank account customers need to maintain a monthly average balance or MAB, which is the average of daily balances in the account during the month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When do SBI savings bank account customers pay this charge?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Failing to maintain the monthly balance as specified by the bank will attract a fee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What to do?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;A regular review of your account will help you to ensure the average monthly balance is maintained and avoid the minimal charges,&amp;rdquo; State Bank of India (SBI) said in another tweet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How much fine do I need to pay?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Banking behemoth SBI has divided its customers into four categories: metro, urban, semi-urban and rural.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For metro customers:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SBI requires its savings bank account customers in metros to maintain a monthly average balance of Rs 5,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case the monthly average balance of an SBI savings bank account holder comes out to be between Rs 2,500 and Rs 5,000 - a shortfall of less than 50 per cent, a charge of Rs 50 plus service tax will be levied, SBI said. For those with a shortfall of between 50 and 75 per cent (MAB from Rs 1,250 to Rs 2,500), a fee of Rs 75 plus service tax will be charged, and Rs 100 plus service tax for those keeping an average less than Rs 749 (more than 75 per cent shortfall).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Shortfall&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;SBI charges plus service tax&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;

&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Over 75%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rs 100&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;50-75%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rs 75&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Till 50%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rs 50&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;50-75%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rs 60&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Till 50%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rs 40&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;Rs 50&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Till 50%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rs 25&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;

&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Over 75%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rs 50&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;50-75%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rs 30&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Till 50%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rs 20&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The charges have been permitted by the Reserve Bank of India and are being levied by banks across the industry &amp;ldquo;and help us in providing better services to the customers&amp;rdquo;, SBI added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides savings bank accounts, SBI offers some other accounts wherein customers are not required to maintain a minimum balance. SBI&amp;rsquo;s small savings bank account and basic savings account are two such products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After its merger with five associate banks and Bharatiya Mahila Bank, SBI has entered the league of top 50 global banks with a balance sheet size of Rs. 41 lakh crore, 2.77 lakh employees, 50 crore customers, over 22,500 branches and 58,000 ATMs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <link>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/can-now-pay-home-loan-emis-from-provident-fund-deposits/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The withdrawal facility from the PF account will be available to only those PF members who fulfil the conditions prescribed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over four crore subscribers of the retirement fund body EPFO can now make down payment and pay EMIs from their EPF accounts to buy homes. The subscribers of the Employees Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) will be able to withdraw up to 90 per cent of their accumulations in their PF account for purchase of homes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EPFO has amended the scheme by inserting a new paragraph - 68 BD - to the Employees&amp;rsquo; Provident Funds (EPF) Scheme, 1952, to enable a subscriber to make down payment to buy homes and pay EMIs through the EPF account, a senior official said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The official said, &amp;ldquo;Since the labour ministry has issued a notification for the purpose, the scheme stands amended.&amp;rdquo; Under the new provision, an EPF subscriber being a member of a co-operative or housing society with at least 10 members can withdraw up to 90 per cent from the fund for purchase of a dwelling house or flat or construction of a dwelling house and acquisition of site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also provides that monthly instalments for repayments of any outstanding payment or interest may also be paid from the amount to the government, housing agency, primary lending agency and banks concerned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the withdrawal facility from the PF account will be available to only those PF members who fulfil the conditions prescribed. One, the member applying under this window should have contributed to the fund for at least three years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The facility will be available only once to every member during his or her lifetime. The rule applies to all those who together with their subscriber spouse have at least Rs 20,000 in their accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The unlimited data at high speed in all of BSNL&amp;rsquo;s Rs. 333, Rs. 339, Rs. 349 and Rs. 395 packs will be reduced to 80 Kbps per second under its fair usage policy, BSNL added.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rs 349&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BSNL&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Dil Khol Ke Bol&amp;rdquo; special tariff voucher priced at Rs 349 comes with a validity of 28 days and includes 2 GB of data per day at 3G speed. Other benefits in the Rs 349 pack include unlimited local and STD calls.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>9 GB Free Data: Vodafone&#39;s Latest Offer In Response To Jio</title>
      <link>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/9-gb-free-data-vodafones-latest-offer-in-response-to-jio/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Since Jio&amp;rsquo;s launch in September, incumbent operators have been coming up with aggressive plans to lure new customers. Vodafone is also currently offering 4 GB data in some circles on upgrade to 4G SIM.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vodafone is giving &lt;em&gt;9 GB data&lt;/em&gt; free to customers in a special scheme, its latest offer to counter Reliance Jio which has come up with aggressive tariff plans. &amp;ldquo;Thank you for making us a 200 million strong family! As a token of appreciation, we are happy to delight you with free data on your Vodafone mobile,&amp;rdquo; Vodafone said. A Vodafone customer care executive said the 9 GB free data offer has been made to select customers. The 9 GB free data will be applicable &lt;em&gt;at 3 GB/month&lt;/em&gt; for three billing cycles. Vodafone said this 9GB offer is in addition to &amp;ldquo;existing data quota on your plan/pack at no extra cost&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since &lt;em&gt;Jio&amp;rsquo;s launch in September,&lt;/em&gt; incumbent operators have been coming up with aggressive plans to lure new customers. Currently, Vodafone is also offering 4 GB data in some circles on upgrade to 4G SIM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New entrant Reliance Jio has kept the pressure on other operators to cut tariffs and make special offers to customers. Jio&amp;rsquo;s current &amp;ldquo;Dhan Dhana Dhan&amp;rdquo; plans offer &amp;ldquo;unlimited&amp;rdquo; data under recharge packs starting from Rs. 309.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, Vodafone said that it will offer free incoming calls during international roaming on its network in 45 countries at a daily rental of Rs. 500 along with all international and local outgoing calls for Rs. 1 a minute. In the countries where Vodafone operates, the customer will get 1 megabyte of mobile internet for Rs. 1 which implies 1 GB of data will cost them Rs. 1,024. &amp;ldquo;Keeping in mind the requirements of international travelers, Vodafone had recently introduced the i-RoamFREE proposition offering free incoming calls, Re 1 for all international and local outgoing calls and data at Re 1 per MB in over 45 countries on a daily basis,&amp;rdquo; Vodafone said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The price war for data subscribers has dented the bottom lines of wireless telecom service providers, yet none of them is likely to pull a punch, Crisil said in a report. If anything, competition will only heat up further given that market leadership is all-crucial to the business, it said. The proposed merger between Idea and Vodafone - which marks the biggest consolidation in the Indian telecom sector - is also part of this quest to strengthen market position, alongside lowering investment needs and costs, Crisil added.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Aadhaar based lic policies</title>
      <link>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/lic-launches-two-aadhaar-based-policies/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 25 Apr 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/lic-launches-two-aadhaar-based-policies/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Life insurance behemoth LIC has introduced two endowment assurance plans for individuals having Aadhaar card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the _Aadhaar Shila _is a plan exclusively designed for women, the other scheme &lt;em&gt;Aadhaar Stambh&lt;/em&gt; is meant for men. Absolute amount assured on death under Aadhaar Stambh is 100%, whereas for Aadhaar Shila it is 110% of basic sum assured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These plans offer a combination of protection and savings and provide a lump-sum amount at the time of maturity for the surviving policyholder and financial support for the family in case of death of the policyholder, a Corporation statement said today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The maturity benefit under both the plans will be the sum assured with loyalty additions if any, it added. Total basic sum assured under all policies issued to an individual under this plan shall not exceed Rs 3 lakh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This plan is available to standard healthy lives from age 8-55 years, without any medical examination. The maximum age of maturity is 70 years and the terms available are from 10 to 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case of death during first five years, the sum assured on death shall be payable. However, in case of death after completion of five policy years but before the date of maturity, the sum assured on death and loyalty addition, if any, shall be payable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sum assured on death is defined as the highest of 10 times of annualised premium or the absolute amount assured to be paid on death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rebate on tabular premium at 2% for year mode and 1% on half-yearly mode is available while quarterly, monthly (through NACH), salary deductions are other modes available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An optional benefit of accident benefit rider is available by payment of additional premium. Loyalty addition is payable on certain conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, these plans also take care of liquidity needs through auto cover as well as loan facility. PTI KD BEN NRB&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the latest version of BHIM e-wallet app on Friday, as the government aggressively pursues a &amp;ldquo;less-cash&amp;rdquo; economy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the latest version of BHIM e-wallet app on Friday, as the government aggressively pursues a &amp;ldquo;less-cash&amp;rdquo; economy to combat the problem of black money and digitise the economy. Promoting the latest version BHIM 1.3, on the 126th birth anniversary of Dr Bhimrao R. Ambedkar, PM Modi said that the BHIM-Aadhaar platform would play the same role of empowering the common Indian as the Constitution of India, framed by Dr Ambedkar. To further incentivize Indians to make the switch to using the BHIM app for transacting business, PM Modi also launched two schemes - cash back for merchants and referral bonus for individual owners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here Are Some Of The Key Features Of BHIM:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;BHIM, short for Bharat Interface for Money, enables its users to transfer money using their mobile phone. The app created a world record by registering 10 million downloads in just four months since its launch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the new cashback scheme, the merchants will get a cashback on every transaction using BHIM. For every successful referral, users can earn Rs. 10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;PM Modi declared on Friday that incentives totalling Rs. 495 crore will be given to merchants for accepting payments through BHIM and existing users for referring it to others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around 2 MB in size, the latest version of the app enables payments through a fingerprint scanner by authenticating biometric details of the user against the Aadhaar database.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The app is available in 12 languages with three new languages (Marathi, Punjabi and Assamese) added in BHIM 1.3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The app, now allows users to transfer money to contacts saved on the phone. However, there&amp;rsquo;s a cap of Rs. 10,000 for a single transaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;At present account holders of around 30 banks can transact on BHIM 1.3. The app will add Punjab And Maharashtra Co-Operative Bank Ltd, Punjab &amp;amp; Sind Bank and Jammu and Kashmir Bank soon, according to its Google Play Store page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike the United Payments Interface (UPI), BHIM users do not need to download mobile applications of multiple banks to transact with different banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the government&amp;rsquo;s move on November 8 last year to demonetise Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 currency notes, the number of digital payment apps have logged a nearly 23-fold increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Developed by National Payments Corporation of India, BHIM aims pave the way for making payments using fingerprints or iris scanners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Your PAN card could become invalid from July 1: Here&#39;s why</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The number of applications submitted for correction of names in Permanent Account Number (PAN) cards have seen a significant jump in recent weeks. This is because the government has set a deadline of July 1, 2017, to link one&amp;rsquo;s PAN with his/her Aadhaar number. But people who do not have a consistent style of spelling their names are facing problems in linking their PAN cards with Aadhaar cards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kamala Radhakrishnan, Vice President (Business Development) at CAMS, empanelled by the National Securities Depository Ltd (NSDL) for PAN applications, says, &amp;ldquo;We understand there is a significant increase in requests for correction of names in PAN cards.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only way out for such people is to either correct the details in their PAN cards or get the changes done in their Aadhaar cards. You can also apply for it online by uploading the requisite documents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amit Maheshwari, Partner at Ashok Maheshwary &amp;amp; Associates LLP, says, &amp;ldquo;If the details in PAN are incorrect, the person is advised to submit a PAN correction form at the designated centres of NSDL with necessary evidences. Similarly, if the details in Aadhaar are to be corrected, the person should visit the designated centres with necessary evidences to get it rectified.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Non-Resident Indians (NRIs), however, are exempted from quoting Aadhaar numbers while filing income-tax returns back home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do not link your PAN card with the Aadhaar card within the stipulated time, it may lead to invalidation of your PAN card. If that happens, you will not be able to file your return this year as quoting both PAN and Aadhaar numbers has been made mandatory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aadhaar is a 12-digit number code, issued by the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI). It is used to establish a person&amp;rsquo;s identity on the basis of demographic and biometric information. The Permanent Account Number or PAN is a 10-digit alphanumeric number issued by the Income-Tax Department for tracking your financial transactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the latest data available, there are more than 24.37 crore PAN registered in the country while Aadhaar cards have been issued to 113 crore people. However, only 2.87 crore individuals filed income-tax returns in the assessment year 2012-2013, out of which 1.62 crore did not pay any tax, leaving the number of taxpayers at just one per cent of the country&amp;rsquo;s total population. Due to such a low number of tax payers in the country, the government intends to catch tax evaders with the linkage of PAN cards with Aadhaar cards.&lt;/p&gt;
