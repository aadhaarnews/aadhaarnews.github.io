&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reliance Jio is offering free voice calls and roaming on all its post-paid and pre-paid plans. Also there is no charge for data used to make 4G voice calls under all its plans.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jio is offering a variety of recharge options and plans to give benefits of hundreds of GBs of 4G data to its prepaid and postpaid subscribers. Beyond the daily 4G data limits of 1GB and 2GB per day across its prepaid recharges and postpaid plans, wherever specified, subscribers will continue to use unlimited internet at a reduced speed of 128 Kbps, as per Jio&amp;rsquo;s website. All schemes under Jio&amp;rsquo;s paid Prime service - prepaid and postpaid alike - include free voice call and roaming benefits. &amp;ldquo;Voice is truly free - no charge towards voice or the data used to make 4G voice calls,&amp;rdquo; Jio added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are various plans offered by Jio, as per its website:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PREPAID&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rs 19&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Valid for just one day, Jio&amp;rsquo;s prepaid offerings start from the Rs 19 recharge, which includes 200 MB of 4G data for Prime members and 100 MB for non-Prime members, as per Jio&amp;rsquo;s website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rs 49&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jio&amp;rsquo;s next recharge is priced at Rs 49. Jio Prime members recharging with the Rs 49 voucher get 600 MB of high speed data over a validity of three days. The 4G data on offer under this pack is limited to 300 MB for non-Prime members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rs. 96&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Valid for seven days, Jio&amp;rsquo;s Rs 96 recharge comes with 1GB of 4G data per day. That is for Prime members. Non-Prime members get 600MB of 4G data for seven days with a recharge of Rs 96.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rs. 149&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jio&amp;rsquo;s Rs 149 recharge pack includes 2GB of 4G data valid for 28 days for Prime users and 1GB for non-Prime subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rs. 309&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prime subscribers buying their first recharge of Rs 309 will get 1GB of 4G data per day for 84 days, as per the Jio website. Subsequent recharges will offer the same quantity of daily 4G data for 28 days, instead of 84 days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rs. 509&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first recharge of Rs 509 offers 2GB of 4G data daily, for 84 days. This is comparable with half of the daily 4G data on offer in the Rs 309 pack. Data benefits on subsequent recharges of Rs 509 will be limited to 28 days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rs 999&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first Rs 999 recharge comes with a validity of 120 days, in which subscribers get 120 GB of 4G data. Subsequent recharges are limited to 60 GB of 4G data for 60 days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rs 1,999&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A first recharge of Rs 1,999 comes with 185 GB of 4G data and validity of 150 days. The 4G data on offer is 125 GB for 90 days on subsequent recharges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rs. 4,999&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those buying their first recharge after subscribing to Prime will get 410 GB of 4G data with a validity of 240 days. Users will get 350 GB of 4G data with a validity of 180 days on subsequent recharges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rs 9,999&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only pack which offers 4G data spanning beyond a year on first recharge is priced at Rs. 9,999. Those buying their first recharge of Rs 9,999 are being offered 810 GB of 4G data with a validity of 420 days. Subsequent recharges will come with 4G data of 750 GB valid for 360 days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;postpaid&#34;&gt;POSTPAID&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rs 309&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First cycle: Jio is offering 1GB of 4G data per day - which sums up to 90GB of 4G data - for a period of three months under this plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subsequent cycle: Customers will get 30GB of 4G data for a period of one month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rs 509&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jio is offering 2GB of 4G data per day for a period of three months on the first cycle, and one month on subsequent cycles. Therefore, users get 180GB of 4G data for three months in the first cycle, and 60GB for one month on subsequent cycles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rs 999&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the first cycle, Jio is offering 180 GB of 4G data for three months under the Rs 999 postpaid plan. Users will get 60 GB of 4G data per month on subsequent cycles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From India&amp;rsquo;s first private small arms manufacturing unit based at Malanpur, M.P., India, and Israel will manufacture lethal Israeli guns for the Indian armed forces and the world. This has been made possible through a joint venture between Indian defence conglomerate, Punj Lloyd, and Israel Weapon Industries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As clearly stated by Army Chief General Bipin Rawat there is a need to invest more in the military, in view of emerging security threats. And these are the guns that will add to the capabilities of the armed forces.&lt;/p&gt;

This weapon was also used during the surgical strikes in POK. The Special Frontier Force (SFF), a covert special operations unit, created with the help of the CIA post the 1962 India-China war, is also using them.&lt;/p&gt;

      <link>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/lost-aadhaar-card-follow-simple-steps-get-duplicate-aadhaar-card/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In a bid to make Aadhaar Card the single identity proof, the government has made all efforts to make sure that the Aadhaar number is linked to bank accounts and tax payments.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nobody likes when their important documents are lost or misplaced. One such crucial document is the Aadhaar Card as the 12-digit unique identity number has become a matter of necessity for various purposes. The Narendra Modi government is completely committed to making Aadhaar the most potent identification instrument for Indian citizen. In a bid to make Aadhaar Card the single identity proof, the government has made all efforts to make sure that the Aadhaar number is linked to bank accounts and tax payments. Today, the Aadhaar card has become one of the vital documents to live in India, it has become a basic necessity and its need is increasing with each passing day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any person can apply for a duplicate Aadhaar card if he/she has lost or misplaced it. In case you do not know or are unsure of your Aadhaar number, or if you have lost or misplaced your acknowledgement slip that you acquired at the time of registration, then you can download a duplicate copy of your Aadhaar card by visiting the UIDAI’s website www.uidai.gov.in . The UIDAI has made it possible for all residents to acquire a duplicate card through a simple procedure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Follow the following steps to get a duplicate Aadhaar card if have misplaced your Aadhaar card&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://aadhaarcardnews.in/images/uid-1.png&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First, go to &lt;a href=&#34;https://resident.uidai.net.in/find-uid-eid&#34;&gt;https://resident.uidai.net.in/find-uid-eid&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select appropriate option, ‘Aadhaar No (UID)’ OR ‘Enrolment No (EID)’, under ‘You want to receive your lost’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enter your full name, your email address and your registered Mobile Number&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enter the security code as displayed and click on “Get OTP” button&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After this, One Time Password (OTP) will be delivered to your mobile and/or email address&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the box below, enter the OTP you just received on your mobile and/or email address and then click on “Verify OTP”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The person will receive a message on your mobile with your Aadhaar card number or Enrollment Id as you selected in Step 2 above&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now go to &lt;a href=&#34;https://eaadhaar.uidai.gov.in/&#34;&gt;https://eaadhaar.uidai.gov.in/&lt;/a&gt; and select appropriate option, “Enrollment Id” OR “Aadhaar”, under “I have:”&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Enter the OTP you just received on your mobile in the “Enter OTP” box and click on “Validate and Download”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now you have downloaded your e-Aadhar card. Enter your Pin Code as the password when you open the PDF document and there you have your e-AADHAR card, which you can print out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the procedure is over, you can now download E-Aadhaar card which will serve as the duplicate Aadhaar card which will be equally helpful. Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley recently said in the Lok Sabha said that efforts are being made to make Aadhaar the only card required to identify a person, replacing Voter ID and PAN. “The unique identification number Aadhaar may become the single identity card in future”, he added.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Rs 30:you could buy a litre of petrol</title>
      <link>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/in-5-years-you-could-buy-a-litre-of-petrol-for-rs-30/</link>

      <description>

&lt;h1 id=&#34;it-s-true&#34;&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s true&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you remember the last time you paid Rs 30 for a litre of petrol? Well, that was 14 years go, July 2003 to be precise. Seems like petrol will go easy on pockets again. In coming five years, you could be paying as less than Rs 30 per litre for the fuel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;future-tech&#34;&gt;Future tech&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A futuristic technology will be decreasing gthe world&amp;rsquo;s dependence on petrol so much that its prices will crash, predicts Tony Seba, an American futurist famous for predicting a boom in solar power when the prices used to be around ten times of what they are today, which came true eventually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seba, a serial Silicon Valley entrepreneur, is also an instructor in Entrepreneurship, Disruption and Clean Energy at Stanford&amp;rsquo;s Continuing Studies Program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;global-oil-demand-to-go-down&#34;&gt;Global oil demand to go down&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding his prediction, Seba says that it is the rise of self-drive cars that would bring down the global demand for oil, reducing the price of oil to $25 a barrel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Oil demand will peak 2021-2020 and will go down 100 million barrels, to 70 million barrels within 10 years. And what that means, the new equilibrium price is going to be $25,&amp;rdquo; says Seba.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;affordable-electric-cars&#34;&gt;Affordable electric cars&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though people would not stop using fuelled cars, they would start using self-drive electric vehicles more, which would be cheaper to buy as well as run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;india-to-go-all-electric-by-2030&#34;&gt;India to go all-electric by 2030&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, Union power minister Piyush Goyal had also said that India was looking to have all-electric car fleet by 2030, meaning that not a single petrol or diesel car would be sold in the country after 15 years.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Your Face Or Fingerprint Could Soon Replace Your Ticket</title>
      <link>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/your-face-or-fingerprint-could-soon-replace-your-plane-ticket/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 08 Jun 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/your-face-or-fingerprint-could-soon-replace-your-plane-ticket/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The first phase of Delta&amp;rsquo;s program will allow its elite-tier passengers to use their fingerprints, rather than their boarding passes, to enter member lounges.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may soon be able to ditch your boarding pass in favor of your fingers or face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, Delta announced a new biometric identification pilot program that will eventually let you use your fingerprints instead of a plane ticket. That followed a JetBlue announcement hours earlier that it is testing a program in Boston that will match pictures of customers&amp;rsquo; faces with the passport database maintained by U.S. Custom and Border Protections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Delta&amp;rsquo;s program, which kicked off at D.C.&amp;rsquo;s Reagan National Airport, is in partnership with Clear, a company that already lets customers skip to the front of security lines without identification. To be eligible for the program, one must be a member of Delta&amp;rsquo;s frequent flyer SkyMiles program and a Clear subscriber.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first phase of Delta&amp;rsquo;s program will allow its elite-tier passengers to use their fingerprints, rather than their boarding passes, to enter member lounges. A planned second phase would allow Delta frequent flyers to use their fingerprint in lieu of a boarding pass. Per its privacy policy, which will cover the Delta program, Clear keeps users&amp;rsquo; biometric information for the term of their subscriptions. Users can ask for their information to be removed from the company&amp;rsquo;s servers and close their accounts at any time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The airline has also announced it will use facial recognition technology for bag drops, with a pilot testing program at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport in the summer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JetBlue&amp;rsquo;s program works in concert with two entities: the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and a tech firm called SITA. Flyers at Boston&amp;rsquo;s Logan International Airport and Aruba&amp;rsquo;s Queen Beatrix International Airport will have the option of going into the normal boarding line, or one with a camera that will snap their picture. SITA will send that photo to the CBP, to match it against the agency&amp;rsquo;s database of passport and visa photos. The match process is instant, JetBlue said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neither JetBlue nor SITA has access to the photo database, and the airline will not store users&amp;rsquo; biometric information, JetBlue confirmed in an email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the facial scan fails to work, passengers will be moved to the traditional line - so don&amp;rsquo;t travel without your ID just yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using biometric data for identification may sound convenient, but people should consider some things before signing up, said Jeramie Scott, national security counsel for the Electronic Privacy Information Center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neither company has released details on how the government may use information on when and where people&amp;rsquo;s faces have been scanned, he said, nor are there laws to prevent the government from using these types of programs as part of larger surveillance plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s a technology that can easily be used for mass, indiscriminate surveillance,&amp;rdquo; he said, of facial recognition technology. &amp;ldquo;Any use for facial recognition for something like this - where it&amp;rsquo;s the government or companies running a facial recognition search on people - needs to be scrutinized very closely by the public, because of the serious risk of mission creep.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. Customs and Border Protection did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bank Loan Or Credit Card Loan: Which One To Go For?</title>
      <link>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/bank-loan-or-credit-card-loan-which-one-to-go-for/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 07 Jun 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/bank-loan-or-credit-card-loan-which-one-to-go-for/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Even if costs like interest rate, pre-closure charges and loan processing fees remain the same for credit card loan and bank personal loan, interest cost of credit card loan become 15 per cent more because of service tax.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just a phone call and money gets credited to your account within 2-3 days. Yes, it is this simple today to get credit card loans. Though credit card loans are easier to get, they come at a higher cost than personal loans from banks. So you need to know clearly when to take a credit card loan or a personal loan. Even if the credit card company charges you the same rate of interest as that of personal loan, the cost for servicing credit card loan is higher. Along with processing fees and pre-closure charges, credit card companies also charge service tax on the interest you pay on your loan every month, which is 15 per cent currently (service tax@14%+ Swach Bharat Cess@ 0.5%+ Krishi Klyan Cess @ 0 .5%).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if costs like interest rate, pre-closure charges and loan processing fees remain the same for credit card loan and bank personal loan, interest cost of credit card loan become 15 per cent more because of service tax.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if you take a personal loan of Rs 1 lakh from a bank at 14 per cent interest for 24 months, then your first month instalment will be Rs 4,802, in which interest component will be Rs 1,166.66 and principal repayment will be Rs 3635.33. If you take the same loan on your credit card at the same interest rate, in the first month you have to pay Rs 4,976.99 which is Rs 175 more than what you pay on a bank loan. This is because of the service tax of Rs 175 on interest of Rs 1,166.66. This service tax is also applicable when you convert your purchases on credit card to equated monthly instalment (EMI).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there are some instances, where credit card loans are preferred over bank personal loans. If the amount you are opting for is less (less than Rs 50,000) and the tenure you want is less than 1 year, then credit card loans become more useful (even with higher cost) because banks generally do not offer personal loans below Rs 50,000 and for less than one year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Credit cards even offer loans even for six months and for small amounts as low as Rs 10,000. If your requirement for funds is for a short term and you think you can repay it faster, then it is worth going for a credit card loan.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Reliance JioFi 3 vs JioFi 2</title>
      <link>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/reliance-jiofi-3-vs-jiofi-2/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 07 Jun 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/reliance-jiofi-3-vs-jiofi-2/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few months back, Reliance Jio silently launched JioFi 3 in the Indian market just to replace its predecessor with some minor changes. We recently unboxed the device. The JioFi 3 now retails at Rs. 1,999 on official aJio website and is also available from Reliance Digital Xpress, Digital Xpress mini and other stores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, this device comes handy when your family and friends want to online On-the-go and also saves your phone’s battery life. With JioFi you can make voice and video calls even on a 2G/3G phone by installing Jio4GVoice (JioJoin previously) app and connecting it to the hotspot over WiFi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, we have compared and jotted down the list of differences between the JioFi 3 and JioFi2.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://aadhaarcardnews.in/images/JioFi-3-vs-JioFi-2.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Design of the box:&lt;/em&gt; The first thing you notice in the JioFi 3 is the circular box design compared to a rectangular box that JioFi 2 came in.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://aadhaarcardnews.in/images/JioFi-3-vs-JioFi-2_fonearena-03-768x609.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Form Factor:&lt;/em&gt; Both the devices varies drastically when it comes to the build quality. While the JioFi 2 comes in a glossy plastic egg shaped body, its successor comes in a square-shaped body with a matte finish.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://aadhaarcardnews.in/images/JioFi-3-vs-JioFi-2_fonearena-10-768x494.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;New OLED display:&lt;/em&gt; One of the highlighted features in the JioFi3 is the addition of OLED display on the front top instead of just icons. The display provides information about the battery life, signal strength, and WiFi status, however it doesn’t have a separate indicator for WPS and data connectivity that were present in the JioFi 2.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://aadhaarcardnews.in/images/JioFi-3-vs-JioFi-2_fonearena-04-300x195.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Button placements and dimensions:&lt;/em&gt; Another minor difference is the placement of buttons on both the devices. In terms of dimensions, the JioFi 3 measures 96.6 x 65.2 x 15.2mm and JioFi 2 is slightly smaller measuring 85.0 x 55.0 x 16.0 mm&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://aadhaarcardnews.in/images/JioFi-3-vs-JioFi-2_fonearena-06-1024x582.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Battery:&lt;/em&gt; Another significant upgrade is in the battery division. The JioFi 3 has been bumped up to 2600mAh when compared to 2300mAh on JioFi 2. As per the company claims, the device promises up to 5 hours of usage and up to 260 hours of standby. Even though there is a 300mAh increase in battery,
the charging time is almost same for both the devices using the bundled AC charger.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://aadhaarcardnews.in/images/JioFi-3-vs-JioFi-2_fonearena-08-768x431.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;SIM and microSD slots:&lt;/em&gt; You need to remove the battery in both the versions but JioFi 3 has a nano SIM slot, which is preferred by most and both the SIM and microSD slots have spring type method so the contacts don’t get damaged. The JioFi 2 has a full sized SIM slot and also came with a Micro to full SIM adapter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of connectivity, both the devices have WiFi 802.11 b/g/n (2.4GHz only) support and option to connect to up to 31 WiFi devices and 1 through USB tethering. Speed is almost same in both the devices through USB tethering and WiFi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The JioFi 3 is available for Rs. 1999 (MOP) same as the JioFi 2 and is a minor improvement when it comes to battery, addition of OLED display and a sturdy body with matte finish.&lt;/p&gt;

Announced in a circular on the SBI website on Thursday morning, the revisions initially created confusion among customers over news that all cash withdrawals through ATM will now be charged at Rs. 25 per transaction. The bank later clarified that the Rs 25 charge will be levied only on withdrawing money from an ATM through SBI’s mobile wallet app “State Bank Buddy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an emailed statement to NDTV Profit, an SBI spokesperson clarified that a limit of four ATM withdrawals per month only applied to the Basic Savings Banks deposit account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All normal Saving Bank accounts will continue to get 8 free ATM transactions (5 SBI ATMs + 3 other bank ATMs) in metros &amp;amp; 10 free transactions in non-metros (5 SBI ATM + 5 Other Bank ATMs) free, the clarification added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from ATM charges, SBI also  revised service charges on various cash transactions for its customers. Here are some of the other key changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Exchange of Soiled Notes:&lt;/em&gt; Going forward SBI said it will charge 2 rupees for every soiled note on exchange of more than 20 notes or if the total value of exchanged notes is above Rs 5,000 plus service tax.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cheque Books:&lt;/em&gt; From June 1, a customers with a Basic Savings Bank Deposit will have to pay Rs 30 plus service tax for a 10 leaf cheque book, Rs 75 with service tax for 25 leaf cheque book and Rs 150 plus service tax for a 50 leaf cheque book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Charges on ATM Cards:&lt;/em&gt; SBI said that issue of new debit cards will be charged from June 1 and only Rupay classic card will be issued for free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cash Withdrawals:&lt;/em&gt; Customers with a Basic Savings Bank Deposit will get four free withdrawals (including ATM) in a month, after which withdrawals will be charged at Rs 50 plus service tax at an SBI branch and at Rs 20 plus service tax at other bank ATMS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>TRAI Launches Three New Mobile Apps For Voice, Data Quality Tracking</title>
      <link>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/trai-launches-three-new-mobile-apps-for-voice-data-quality-tracking/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 07 Jun 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;TRAI MyCall App is an Android application for crowd sourced voice call quality monitoring.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aiming to protect consumer interests, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) on Monday launched three new mobile applications and a web portal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TRAI MyCall App is an Android application for crowd sourced voice call quality monitoring. The app will help mobile phone users rate their experience about voice call quality in real time and help TRAI gather customer experience data along with network data, an official TRAI statement said here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The app is available on Google Playstore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The regulator has launched new version of TRAI MySpeed App that will enable the regulator to obtain test-driven data from users in all service areas, without any action by the users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;These tests would be brief, very infrequent for a specific device, free to the user and anonymous. The user may also do a test and submit the results, as before,&amp;rdquo; the regulator said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also launched DND 2.0 App (Do Not Disturb) Services App that will help smartphone users to register their mobile number under DND to avoid unsolicited commercial communication/ telemarketing calls/ SMS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, TRAI has also launched a new website.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Banking on Aadhaar without bank accounts via IndiaPost payments bank can be a real game-changer</title>
      <link>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/banking-aadhaar-without-bank-accounts-via-indiapost-payments-bank/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 06 Jun 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/banking-aadhaar-without-bank-accounts-via-indiapost-payments-bank/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aadhaar-based transactions by people even without a bank account through the IndiaPost payments bank’s Aadhaar-pay model could be the real game-changer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It appears extremely attractive in the context of the government’s drive to promote digital transactions in a big way that Aadhaar numbers of the people—the total number has touched 112 crore already—will be good enough to pay or receive money, even without a bank account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what IndiaPost payments bank is striving to establish as its basic model once it starts operations in the next few months. According to its CEO A P Singh this can change the face of financial transaction in the country, especially in the rural areas where post offices can play a big role in promoting financial inclusion and handling direct benefit transfers (DBT), which is still around Rs 50,000 crore in a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way it will work is, take for example MGNREGA payment to a worker is sent to the nearest post office mentioning his/her Aadhaar number. The worker will go to the post office, complete the Aadhaar authentication process, and just take out that money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will be various options with him apart from just taking cash—he/she can open an account with the IndiaPost payments bank immediately as the e-KYC process is complete with Aadhaar authentication, or just take a pre-paid card which can be used in any ATM to withdraw cash or make payments anywhere just as a debit card does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Switch to normal transaction between two persons, and the same thing can be replicated through mobile wallets without bringing in any bank account. Going ahead, India Post is planning to equip the postman with biometric authentication and payment machines to remove the hassle of even going to the post offices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the extensive reach of India Post throughout the country, something that has been a major bottleneck for the banks in handling transactions in rural areas and also DBT, Aadhaar-post combine can prove to be a big driver here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That India Post is targeting about 650 districts in the country in the initial stages itself with the help of those having feature phones and even those who have not, through its network, indicates that the door-to-door banking model may soon become a reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, for this model to succeed, the mobile and broadband connectivity in the rural areas will also have to improve besides Aadhaar seeding, which to a certain extent is happening at a better pace now than what it was in the UPA years, even after the launch of DBT on January 1, 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only about 35% people in India are having internet facility, and out of the 65,475 gram panchayats with access to the optic fibre laid under the BharatNet project, according to a report in The Indian express, less than 25% have active internet. So, even though the government, as announced in the Budget, achieves the target of taking broadband connectivity to 1.5 lakh panchayats by the end of 2017-18—it will be of help if there is a working internet available in these panchayats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Jio recorded all-time high download speed of 19.12 MB per second&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Telecom regulator TRAI collects download speed on a real-time basis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jio overtook its own performance of 18.48 mbps in previous month&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reliance Jio topped the chart in 4G network speed for the month of April with an all-time high download speed of 19.12 megabit per second, according to the latest report by telecom regulator TRAI (Telecom Regulatory Authority of India).

&lt;p&gt;Vodafone India and Idea Cellular have announced merger of their operations to create the country&amp;rsquo;s largest mobile phone operator worth more than $23 billion with a 35 per cent market share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As per the monthly trend on TRAI&amp;rsquo;s portal, Bharti Airtel logged average download speed of 10.15 mbps in April.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>National Pension Scheme (NPS) Or Public Provident Fund (PPF): Which One To Pick?</title>
      <link>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/article-national-pension-scheme-nps-or-public-provident-fund-ppf-which-one-to-pick/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 06 Jun 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/article-national-pension-scheme-nps-or-public-provident-fund-ppf-which-one-to-pick/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Although EPF is an option for salaried employees only, PPF is for all.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Public Provident Fund (PPF) and Provident Fund (PF) take centre stage whenever savings for retirement come to mind for most of us. Although EPF or Employees&amp;rsquo; Provident Fund is for salaried employees only, PPF is for all. People have been investing in PPF - which provides secured return over the long term - for ages. However, the National Pension Scheme or NPS has been gaining lot of attention as a retirement savings product after the government provided additional tax deduction of Rs. 50,000 in Budget 2015-16. Under NPS, there are two types of accounts: Tier I and Tier II. While the Tier I account is non-withdrawable till the age of 60 except in specific situations, the Tier II account is a voluntary savings account. Subscribers to Tier II accounts can withdraw the money whenever they want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the key differences between NPS and PPF:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;who-can-invest&#34;&gt;Who can invest?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A PPF account can be opened by any Indian resident. One can also open a PPF account in the name of his or her minor children and can avail tax benefit on the contribution. However, an NPS account can be opened by Indian citizens above 18 years and less than 60 years of age. Non-resident Indians (NRIs) can also open an NPS account, but they cannot open a PPF account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;maturity&#34;&gt;Maturity&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A PPF account matures in 15 years. One can also extend this term after 15 years by a block of five years with or without making further contribution. However, in case of NPS, the maturity tenure is not fixed. You can contribute to the NPS account till the age of 60 years with an option to extend the investment to the age of 70 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;investment-limit&#34;&gt;Investment limit&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One has to contribute a minimum Rs 500 to a PPF account annually with the maximum amount capped at Rs 1,50,000. A maximum 12 contributions per year are allowed in PPF accounts. However, in case of NPS, the minimum contribution required is Rs 6,000. There is no limit on contribution as long as it does not exceed 10 per cent of your salary, or 10 per cent of your gross total income in case of self-employed. But tax benefit will be available only on Rs 1.5 lakh under Section 80CCD(1) of the Income Tax Act, and an additional Rs 50,000 will be available under Section 80CCD(2) - a total tax benefit of up to Rs 2 lakh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Premature withdrawal/partial withdrawal: In case of PPF, partial withdrawals are allowed from the seventh year onwards with some limitation. One can also avail loan against his or her PPF account during the third and sixth financial years of opening the account with certain limitations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case of NPS, after 10 years, subscribers become eligible for early, partial withdrawal under specific circumstance like children&amp;rsquo;s higher education or marriage, construction or purchase of house and treatment of critical illness (for self, spouse, children or dependant parents). But if you want to exit before retirement, you must use at least 80 per cent of the accumulated corpus to buy an annuity from a life insurance company including LIC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;investment-option&#34;&gt;Investment option&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case of PPF, you do not have any discretion in deciding where to invest your money. However, in NPS, you can choose from a mix of three funds - equity funds, government securities fund and fixed income instruments other that government securities. A subscriber is allowed to invest up to 75 per cent in the equity fund.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;returns&#34;&gt;Returns&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For PPF subscribers, interest rate is announced every quarter by the government. In case of NPS, returns are market-linked. &amp;ldquo;In our view, the potential of returns in a market-related investment like NPS is higher than of a guaranteed return instrument like PPF/PF. This is due to two reasons, one is the choice of equity exposure in NPS and secondly the component of professional fund management,&amp;rdquo; Manog Nagpal, CEO of Outlook Asia Capital, told NDTV Profit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Mr Nagpal added: &amp;ldquo;PPF continues to be an attractive investment in itself, for those looking at zero volatility and a guarantee (in return). On a risk-adjusted basis, PPF returns though will be lower, will not be subject to the vagaries of the market.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;tax-treatment&#34;&gt;Tax Treatment&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PPF enjoys an EEE or &amp;lsquo;exempt, exempt, exempt&amp;rsquo; status, where the amount you contribute (up to Rs 1.5 lakh), the return you get and the maturity amount, all are tax exempt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, NPS comes under an EET or &amp;lsquo;exempt, exempt, tax&amp;rsquo; tax structure. This means that contributions to NPS and the growth in corpus are not taxed but the lump sum withdrawn is partially taxed. Lump sum withdrawals above 40 per cent of the maturity amount are taxable in NPS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;annuity&#34;&gt;Annuity&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At maturity, you have to mandatorily purchase an annuity for at least 40 per cent of the accumulated wealth in case of NPS. But in case of a maturity amount less than Rs 2 lakh, you have the option of complete withdrawal. However, in case of PPF, you are not required to buy any annuity at the time of maturity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the reason NPS is purely a retirement savings scheme. You cannot use NPS for other purposes like children&amp;rsquo;s education, daughter&amp;rsquo;s marriage etc., which you can do with PPF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although there are certain limitations in NPS, it scores over PPF as a retirement savings scheme on various grounds, say financial planners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In line with the government&amp;rsquo;s push on affordable housing, State Bank of India or SBI is offering an interest rate of 8.35 per cent on home loans up to Rs 30 lakh. Eligible borrowers of home loans from SBI, which last month cut its home loan interest rates to the lowest rate in the market, can also avail an interest subsidy up to Rs. 2.67 lakh under the &amp;lsquo;Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana&amp;rsquo;, a government scheme aimed at providing subsidised housing loans to the low and middle income groups. Also, customers of other banks can also transfer their existing home loans to SBI at &amp;ldquo;no processing fee charges!&amp;rdquo; according to an advertisement by SBI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are five things to know on SBI&amp;rsquo;s affordable home loans scheme:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;With a drop in interest rates and significant interest subsidy benefits offered by the Government of India, the affordable housing segment is poised for a major leap forward in the near future, with projects specially designed for the middle and lower income segments,&amp;rdquo; SBI said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Home loan borrowers buying their first home are eligible for subsidy on interest repayments under the Pradhan Mantri Awas scheme, which is a credit-linked subsidy scheme run by the government. National Housing Bank or NHB has come up with operational guidelines for availing subsidy under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban) for middle-income groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SBI is offering home loan takeovers without any processing fee till June 30, 2017. This facility is applicable on home loans from scheduled commercial bank, private and foreign banks and housing finance companies (HFCs) registered with the National Housing Bank (NHB), among others, SBI said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SBI has also launched a mobile app - SBI Loans - that enables customers to check loan eligibility and apply for home loans online. The SBI Loans app is available on both Android and iPhone platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SBI Minimum Balance: Amount Required, </title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What is the minimum balance required in my SBI savings account?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SBI has said its savings bank account holders in rural, semi-urban, urban and metro branches need to maintain an average balance of Rs 1,000, Rs 2,000, Rs 3,000 and Rs 5,000, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, SBI last month merged its operations with five of its associate banks and Bharatiya Mahila Bank, joining &amp;ldquo;the coveted league of Global Top 50 banks&amp;rdquo;, it said in another Tweet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SBI has revised its service charges across functions from April 4 this year, under which it levies a penalty - which is exclusive of service tax - on its savings account customers based on the quantum of shortfall between the monthly average balance and the prescribed limit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;From Airtel&amp;rsquo;s Rs 244 plan to Vodafone&amp;rsquo;s Rs 352 recharge pack, the incumbent telecom operators are aiming to retain their existing customers based on their individual usage.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As new comer Jio, the telecom arm of conglomerate Reliance Industries, continues to offer discounted tariffs under its &amp;ldquo;Jio Dhan Dhana Dhan&amp;rdquo; offer in a bid to attract more customers, top two telecom players - Airtel and Vodafone - have launched data-oriented prepaid plans and offers to restrict their existing customers to switch to Reliance Jio. From Airtel&amp;rsquo;s Rs 244 plan to Vodafone&amp;rsquo;s Rs 352 recharge pack, the incumbent telecom operators are aiming to retain their existing customers based on their individual usage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;here-are-some-of-the-recharge-plans-offered-by-airtel-and-vodafone-to-counter-jio-s-offers&#34;&gt;Here are some of the recharge plans offered by Airtel and Vodafone to counter Jio&amp;rsquo;s offers:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;airtel-rs-399-recharge&#34;&gt;Airtel Rs 399 recharge&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the Rs 399 recharge pack, Airtel is offering 1GB of 4G data per day along with free voice calls to any network for 70 days. However, there are some limitations on voice calls. You can do 300 minutes of calling per day from Airtel to Airtel (1200 minutes in a week) and for other networks, 3,000 minutes of free local and STD calls for 70 days. If you exhaust the free minutes, Rs 0.10 per minute will be charged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Airtel is offering 2GB of data per day at 4G speed for 28 days under its new Rs 345 recharge pack. Also, now there is no restriction with regard to the timing of data consumption. Under the earlier Rs 345 recharge pack, users were restricted to use only 500 MB of data daily from 6 am till midnight , and the remaining 500 MB between 12 am and 6 am. Along with the above data, users will also get free voice calls to Airtel and other networks as it is in the Rs 399 pack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;airtel-rs-244-recharge&#34;&gt;Airtel Rs. 244 recharge&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the Rs 244 recharge, users will get 1 GB of 4G data per day for 70 days without any restriction on usage timing. But this pack offers free calls on Airtel networks only (300 minutes of daily Airtel-to-Airtel calling and 1,200 minutes for a week for 70 days).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above three recharge packs of Airtel have become active from April 15, 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;vodafone-rs-352-recharge&#34;&gt;Vodafone Rs. 352 recharge&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under its Rs 352 recharge pack, Vodafone offers 1GB of data per day for 56 days along with unlimited local and STD calls with a capping of 300 minutes in a day and 1,200 minutes in a week.
