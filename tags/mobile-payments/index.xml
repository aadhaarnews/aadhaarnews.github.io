      <description>Several petitions challenging the constitutional validity of the Unique Identity programme Aadhaar are pending in the Supreme Court.

Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi told the top court that the idea behind making Aadhaar mandatory for welfare schemes was that the benefit should not go to &amp;ldquo;ghosts&amp;rdquo; as was noticed in schemes like the public distribution system (PDS).</description>
