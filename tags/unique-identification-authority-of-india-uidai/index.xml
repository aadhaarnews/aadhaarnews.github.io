      <title>PF (Provident Fund) Money Withdrawal: Here Are Five Things To Know</title>
      <link>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/pf-provident-fund-money-withdrawal-here-are-five-things-to-know/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As per PF rules, 12% of an employee&amp;rsquo;s salary goes into the fund along with a matching contribution from the employer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Provident fund (PF) is meant for saving towards retirement years. Financial planners don&amp;rsquo;t advise withdrawal from the corpus before retirement. According to provident fund norms, 12 per cent of an employee&amp;rsquo;s salary goes into the fund along with a matching contribution from the employer. The EPFO (Employees&amp;rsquo; Provident Fund Organisation) every year announces interest rate to be paid on the accumulated provident fund corpus. The PF money can be withdrawn after two months from the cessation of employment. The application form in this regard can be filed with PF authorities, or through the employer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are five things to know:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) To encourage long-term savings, the government has formulated tax laws accordingly. If the withdrawal from a recognised PF happens after five years of continuous employment, it attracts no tax liability. In case of employment with different employers, if the PF balance maintained with the old employer is transferred to the PF account of the new employer, it is considered a continuous employment. (Also read: I Want To Save Enough Money For Retirement. Is PF Contribution Enough?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If an employee has been terminated because of certain reasons beyond his or her control (such as ill health and discontinuation of business of employer), a withdrawal does not attract any tax, irrespective of the number of years of employment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) In case of a withdrawal before five years, the amount becomes taxable in the same financial year. Thus, the amount has to be shown in your tax return for the next assessment year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) The employer&amp;rsquo;s contribution to PF and interest earned on it is added to one&amp;rsquo;s income and taxed accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) In addition, if you have claimed benefits under Section 80C on your own PF contribution, it will be taxed as salary. The interest earned on your own contribution will be taxed as &amp;lsquo;income from other sources&amp;rsquo; and taxed according to the respective tax slabs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5) TDS (tax deducted at source) - If the withdrawal is after a period of five years of continuous employment, it attracts no TDS or any tax. What happens if the period of service is less than five years? If PAN has not been submitted to the EPFO authorities, TDS is deducted at 30 per cent. If PAN has been submitted along with Form 15G/15H, no TDS is deducted. If form 15G/15H is not submitted and PAN is submitted, TDS @ 10% is deducted. Form 15H or 15G is meant to prevent TDS for those whose income falls below the taxable limit.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pensioners told to apply for Aadhaar card to receive pension</title>
      <link>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/pensioners-told-apply-aadhaar-card-receive-pension/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 14 Mar 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/pensioners-told-apply-aadhaar-card-receive-pension/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ministry has issued a notification making Aadhaar mandatory for pensioners to receive pension. The pensioners number approximately 25 lakh&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To receive a pension, the Union Defence Ministry in its notification stated all defence pensioners and family members of a deceased personnel ‘will be required to enrol for Aadhar card latest by June 30 to receive pension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ministry has issued a notification making Aadhaar mandatory for pensioners to receive pension. The pensioners number approximately is 25 lakh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Any pensioner eligible to receive benefits and who hasn’t enrolled for Aadhaar, but wants to avail pension is required to apply for Aadhaar by June 30,” read the notification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also stated that the ministry through agencies or other means is required to offer Aadhaar enrollment facilities for beneficiaries who have not yet applied for the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The order stated the Defence Ministry through such agencies will be required to provide Aadhaar enrolment facilities in places where such facilities aren’t available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Till the time Aadhaar card is not given, beneficiaries shall get on producing the ex-servicemen card. A copy of his or her request made for Aadhaar enrolment can be submitted along with a copy of Voter ID card or PAN Card or Passport among others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The notification said Defence Ministry through related agencies should make arrangements to provide hassle-free pension benefits to the beneficiaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wide publicity through media and through other sources should be given and individual notices shall be handed over to pensioners to make them aware of the Aadhaar requirement under the scheme, it added.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Aadhaar Pay launch by month-end</title>
      <link>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/aadhaar-pay-launch-month-end/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 08 Mar 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/aadhaar-pay-launch-month-end/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Centre has asked all banks to launch Aadhaar Pay, which will facilitate financial transactions by using fingerprints, by the end of the month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All banks will also have to enable ‘Pay to Aadhaar’ facility on the BHIM app by March 31 with SBI and Punjab National Bank asked to provide the facility by the end of the week. This feature on BHIM will help in making payments by simply entering the 12-digit Aadhaar number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The twin moves, which will make digital transactions easier, will encourage the use of online payments among the poor and illiterate in rural areas. The government has nudged banks to expedite seeding of Aadhaar numbers and also mobile numbers which are key to accelerate the big initiative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experts believe that Aadhaar Pay, which is the merchant version of the already in use Aadhaar-enabled payment system (AEPS), will become an alternative for all online and card transactions which require password and PIN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The app allows merchants to take cashless payments from a customer who is only required to give his Aadhaar number, name of the bank (from where the money is to be deducted) and fingerprint for authentication. To use this service, the customer has to first link his/her bank account to the Aadhaar number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aadhaar Pay works on any android-based phone, even a low cost one, with an attached finger biometric device. A top government official said banks have been directed to take merchants on board for using BHIM, fitted with ‘Pay to Aadhaar’ feature and Aadhaar Pay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another official said that banks have been asked to speed up deployment of normal PoS (point of sale)machines.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Link Aadhaar number with bank accounts</title>
      <link>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/link-aadhaar-number-bank-accounts/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 08 Mar 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/link-aadhaar-number-bank-accounts/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Account holders with banks have been asked to link their accounts with their Aadhaar number and also provide mobile phone number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lead Bank Manager A. Sakthivel held a discussion with the representatives of all banks here on Monday to encourage their customers to provide the Aadhaar number and mobile phone numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A communication from the Union Finance Ministry said that only 44 per cent of the bank customers had provided their Aadhaar numbers. Similarly, the banks have mobile numbers of only 75 per cent of their account holders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aadhaar numbers are mandatory for digital transactions. Hence, the customers had been asked to provide a self-attested photocopy of Aadhar card with their mobile number and account number, said Mr. Sakthivel.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>No One Will Be Deprived Of Benefits For Lack Of Aadhaar: Government</title>
      <link>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/no-one-will-be-deprived-of-benefits-for-lack-of-aadhaar-government/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 08 Mar 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/no-one-will-be-deprived-of-benefits-for-lack-of-aadhaar-government/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aadhaar has so far been given to more than 112 crore people in the country.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Citizens can avail all the benefits of government schemes on alternate means of identification till the time they get their Aadhaar number, the government said today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;No one will be deprived of the benefits for lack of Aadhaar&amp;hellip; Till Aadhaar number is assigned to any individual, the benefit will continue to be given based on alternate means of identification,&amp;rdquo; according to a statement issued by the Cabinet Secretariat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aadhaar has so far been given to more than 112 crore people in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;In case of Mid-Day Meal scheme and under the Integrated Child Development Scheme, the schools and Anganwadis have been asked to collect the Aadhaar number of the children beneficiaries and in case a child does not have Aadhaar, the school or ICDS functionary will be required to provide enrolment facilities to a child and till Aadhaar number is assigned, the benefits will continue,&amp;rdquo; the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering the usefulness of Aadhaar in curbing leakages and bringing transparency in delivery system, the government has recently issued orders to use Aadhaar in several other welfare schemes funded from the Consolidated Fund of India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;While these orders require beneficiaries of these programmes to give their Aadhaar number, it has also been ensured that no one is deprived of the benefits for want of Aadhaar,&amp;rdquo; it said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total savings by plugging leakages on account of Aadhaar introduction during the last two-and-a-half years in just a few schemes amount to over Rs 49,000 crore.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Aadhaar Enabled Payment System (AEPS) saw 2.65M transactions in January</title>
      <link>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/aadhaar-enabled-payment-system-aeps-saw-2-65m-transactions-january/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 07 Mar 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/aadhaar-enabled-payment-system-aeps-saw-2-65m-transactions-january/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The number of financial transactions of the Aadhaar Enabled Payment System (AEPS) for the month of January 2017 stood at 2.65 million and the value of these transactions stood at Rs 316 crore, National Payments Corporation of India data showed. In December 2016, the number of financial transactions on the AEPS stood at 1.97 million with a value of Rs 207 crore. Financial transactions include cash withdrawal and cash deposits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number of transactions on the payment system grew sharply following the demonetization of Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes.  To give context, the volume of transactions on the AEPS for the financial year 2015-16 was 0.36 million with the value of transactions at Rs 86 crore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that in January government had claimed that “more than 33.87 crore transactions have taken place through AEPS, which was only 46 lakhs in May 2014.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AEPS is a financial inclusion product developed by the NPCI which allows cash withdrawal, deposit and funds transfer at POS (Micro ATM) through a business correspondent of any bank using the Aadhaar authentication. So far, there are 119 banks on the AEPS. Most recently, Spice Money, the domestic remittance service from Spice Digital, got permission from the NPCI to process payments over the AEPS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AEPS also allows a number of non-financial transactions such as balance enquiry and mini statements. For January 2017, the number stood at 1.6 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reminder: So far there are three other payment infrastructures which are linked or will be liked to the Aadhaar:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– First is the Unified Payments Interface (UPI). Although the UPI currently only maps a bank account to the registered mobile number. The second version of the UPI is supposed to have Aadhaar integration by March 2017. Note that the draft paper for the UPI had detailed out that it would be using     the Aadhaar to map out financial addresses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– Second is the Aadhaar Pay. The government launched the Aadhaar Pay in January. Customers can pay using their bank account linked with Aadhaar. To process payments, the customers will need to provide their Aadhaar number to the merchant and authorize payment through their fingerprint. The solution requires a biometric device to be linked to merchant’s mobile phone for payment authentication but customers do not need the phone at all. Currently, 14 banks have signed up for Aadhaar Pay as indicated by this Economic Times report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– The third is the Aadhaar Payments Bridge System (APBS) which is responsible for direct benefit transfer of subsidies by the government. Subsidies will be transferred to bank accounts linked to Aadhaar. The total number of transactions on the APBS were logged in 167.36 crore worth Rs 44,967 crore which has risen by ten folds in value since 31st May 2014 ( 7 crore transactions, worth Rs 4000 crores ).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Aadhaar may be made mandatory for all 84 DBT schemes: Report</title>
      <link>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/aadhaar-may-made-mandatory-84-dbt-schemes-report/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 07 Mar 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/aadhaar-may-made-mandatory-84-dbt-schemes-report/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;So far, furnishing the Aadhaar card has been made mandatory by the government for nearly 34-35 central schemes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furnishing the Aadhaar card has now been made mandatory by the government for nearly 34-35 central schemes, whether it is investing in the employee provident fund (EPF) or availing mid-day meals in schools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to a report in the Economic Times today, this could soon extend to all 84 schemes so far under the Direct subsidy Benefit Transfer scheme. The 12 digit unique-identity number issued to Indian residents based on their biometric and demographic data, has helped the exchequer save nearly Rs 49,000 crore over the last couple of years in DBT under various schemes including LPG subsidy and helped more than 4.47 crore people open bank accounts through e-KYC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the other schemes that are now covered under the mandatory Aadhaar are Sarv Shiksha Abhiyan meant to make elementary education universal, skill training programmes National Social Assistance Programme and Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana, National Action Plan for skill training of disabled and for disabled persons seeking aids and appliances, Swadhar Greh Scheme for rehabilitation of sexually exploited women, and LPG and foodgrains under the public distribution system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aadhaar will also be required of NGOs seeking assistance for working on welfare of SCs, backward castes, alcoholics and old people. Residents who are yet to get their Aadhaar card made can do so until June 30. Enrolment facility will be made available by the department at convenient locations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For anyone wanting to avail benefits while Aadhaar is still under process, the enrolment slip can be used along with any one of the nine prescribed identity proof documents. However, according to a source, notifications from the department on the use of Aadhaar clearly states, “no person will be denied any benefit for want of Aadhaar if he needs the benefit in a time-bound manner or as an emergency measure”.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Aadhaar-Based Authentication Is ‘Fully Safe And Secure’, Assures UIDAI</title>
      <link>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/aadhaar-based-authentication-fully-safe-secure-assures-uidai/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 07 Mar 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/aadhaar-based-authentication-fully-safe-secure-assures-uidai/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;UIDAI dismissed the recently-reported breach as an isolated case, and added that their internal security system had picked up the attempted misuse.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dismissing reports of misuse of biometrics data, the government on Sunday said Aadhaar-based authentication is “fully safe and secure”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, subsidy transfers linked to Aadhaar has led the exchequer to save ₹49,000 crore during the last two-and-half years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), there has been no incident of misuse of Aadhaar biometrics leading to identity theft and financial loss when more than 400 crore Aadhaar authenticated transactions took place during the last five years, it said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UIDAI also said that it has carefully gone through various reports and would like to emphasise that there has been no breach to UIDAI database of Aadhaar in any manner whatsoever and personal data of individuals held by UIDAI is fully safe and secure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With reference to an incident of misuse of biometrics reported in a newspaper, UIDAI said that it is an isolated case of an employee working with a bank’s Business Correspondent’s company making an attempt to misuse his own biometrics which was detected by UIDAI internal security system and subsequently actions under the Aadhaar Act were initiated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Responding to media reports about on-boarding of the ecosystem partners, UIDAI said that the regulations under the Aadhaar Act strictly regulate the on-boarding, functioning including the data sharing restrictions imposed on the companies which want to use Aadhaar information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UIDAI further said that Aadhaar is an important tool of good governance and empowerment of people and has helped more than 4.47 crore people open bank accounts through Aadhaar e-KYC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has enabled the government to do Direct Benefit Transfers under various schemes including LPG subsidy and has helped the exchequer save over ₹49,000 crore during the last two and half years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aadhaar-based Public Distributions System is benefiting people by ensuring that their food grain entitlement are given only to the deserving beneficiaries and are not cornered by unscrupulous and corrupt elements, it said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With reference to reports that there are no extant regulations available to prevent storage and misuse of e-KYC data, while citing instances like capturing IRIS from high resolution photograph, UIDAI said that there are stringent provisions in the Aadhaar (Authentication) Regulations governing the usage of e-KYC data including storage and sharing, resident consent being paramount in both the cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any unauthorised capture of IRIS or fingerprints or storage or replay of biometrics or their misuse is a criminal offence under the Aadhaar Act, it said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On reports of misuse of e-KYC data by various agencies and allegations that the e-KYC API is available in public domain, UIDAI said that e-KYC APIs are available only to authorised Authentication User Agencies (AUAs) and e-KYC User Agencies (KUAs) through authorised Authentication Service agencies (ASAs) which have established secured network connectivity for the purpose of authentication with the Central Identities Data Repository (CIDR).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authorisation is in compliance with the Regulations, specifications, standards and technology architecture as prescribed, it said, adding, any violation would lead to penal action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The statement said that news reports also speak of private agencies hired by mobile operators and banks for e-KYC leading to availability of these data in parallel database and the vulnerabilities in the scenario where there is no privacy law in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this regard, the authority pointed out that “Aadhaar authentication or e-KYC is only available to authorised agencies whose appointment, responsibilities, statutory obligations, penal provisions for contraventions are clearly provided for in the Aadhaar Act and the regulations framed thereunder.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Banks or mobile operators have to become UIDAI’s AUA/ASAs to obtain e-KYC data of their customers from UIDAI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The e-KYC data can be given by UIDAI to these agencies only after they obtain consent of their customers and can be used only for the purpose for which it was obtained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Citing an example, it said, a telecom operator can obtain the e-KYC data of its subscribers and will keep them in their records without biometrics and use them only for the purpose of proving telecom services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, a bank, after obtaining the e-KYC information of its account holders, will keep the information without their biometrics within the bank and will use it only for the purpose of providing banking services and cannot use it for any other purpose without obtaining consent of the customer, it said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UIDAI uses one of world’s most advanced encryption technologies in transmission and storage of data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, it said, that during the last 7 seven years, there has been no report of breach or leak of residents’ data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authority is continuously updating its security parameters looking at the new threats in cyber space, the statement said, adding, it also undertakes security audits and ensures necessary steps to augment security features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UIDAI has decided to have registered devices for capturing biometrics data and such biometrics will be encrypted at the point of capture itself.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Aadhaar Database Safe, Verification Process Was Misused, Say Authorities</title>
      <link>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/aadhaar-database-safe-verification-process-misused-say-authorities/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 02 Mar 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/aadhaar-database-safe-verification-process-misused-say-authorities/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As the Centre expands the list of government services that would require beneficiaries to have an Aadhaar number, the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) on Tuesday insisted that its biometrics database of a billion people was safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reassurance comes against the backdrop of the authority suspending Aadhaar authentication services of Axis Bank after a business correspondent sent a large number of authentication requests to the UIDAI; in each case the fingerprint was exactly the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While UIDAI says the authority is yet to get the probe report, an official said this indicated at the possibility that someone was sending a stored version of the fingerprint. The unusual activity was flagged by the UIDAI’s security system and a complaint registered with Delhi Police’s cyber cell for breach of its regulations, a UIDAI official said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from Axis bank, the complaint had also named its business correspondent Suvidhaa Infoserve and e-sign provider eMudhra, which has denied that it saved any biometrics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Aadhaar law does not allow anyone to store biometrics taken by anyone for authentication by UIDAI, or send a stored version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A top UIDAI official said this was an instance of misuse of Aadhaar authentication by a private party, not a breach. “There hasn’t been a breach of any biometric data… which is not shared anybody under any circumstances,” the official said, pointing that was barred from sharing the data under the law enacted parliament.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2016 law also empowered the government to list government services that can be provided to people if they have an Aadhaar number, or have enrolled for one. Over the last few weeks, the government has mandated that people who produce the number for getting subsidised rations, scholarship for students or benefits at Anganwadi, the government-funded child-care and mother-care programme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since September 2010 when the first Aadhaar number was issued to a woman in Maharashtra’s Nandurbag district, UIDAI has issued the 12-digit identity number – that is key to the government’s thrust on cashless transactions and direct benefit transfer programmes – to 112 crore people. The authority has so far authenticated 490 crore transactions, an average of four transactions for every number issued.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Aadhaar not mandatory for withdrawals under EPS, says EPFO</title>
      <link>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/aadhaar-not-mandatory-withdrawals-eps-says-epfo/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 02 Mar 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/aadhaar-not-mandatory-withdrawals-eps-says-epfo/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Rolling back its earlier decision, retirement fund body EPFO on Tuesday said Aadhaar was no longer mandatory for withdrawal claims under EPS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“…It has been decided that obtaining of Aadhaar should be mandatory for the time being only for pension (10D claims) and not in withdrawal cases (Form 10C),” said a circular issued to all zonal offices on February 27, by the Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Form 10C is used for withdrawal benefits, employer share refunds and scheme certificates before completion of 10 years in service, while form 10D is for withdrawal of pension after superannuation, widow/orphan/disability pension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, the retirement fund body had extended the deadline for submitting Aadhaar till March 31, extending its earlier deadline of February 28. In its January 4 notification, the Labour Ministry had made it mandatory for 4 crore PF subscribers and 50 lakh pensioners of the Employees Pension Scheme (EPS) to furnish proof of possession of the Aadhaar number or undergo Aadhaar authentication, as per procedures laid down by EPFO, to avail of benefits under EPFO schemes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its February 27 circular, EPFO said: “It has been brought to notice that with the present instructions on mandatory obtaining Aadhaar No. for settlement of pension cases, it is not possible to sanction withdrawal benefit claims in Form10C also if Aadhaar No. is not furnished. This has led to issues in settlement in withdrawals,” adding that after examining the matter, it had decided that Aadhaar was no longer required for withdrawal of claims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EPFO, however, urged all zonal offices to expedite linking of Aadhaar for pensioners under EPS 1995 “at the earliest.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, EPFO introduced a single-page form to submit claims with self-attestation and without employer attestation. Earlier, subscribers who had seeded Aadhaar and bank account details to their Universal Account Number (UAN) without employer attestation had to fill claims in Forms No. 19 (UAN), 10C (UAN) &amp;amp; 31(UAN). For subscribers yet to seed Aadhaar and bank details with their UAN, another single form has been introduced to replace forms No. 19, 10C &amp;amp; 31.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;India Post Payments Bank CEO Ashok Pal Singh says the bank will focus on mutual funds, pure life insurance products and small loans&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India Post Payments Bank Ltd’s managing director and chief executive officer Ashok Pal Singh wants to keep it simple. The bank will offer payment solutions for recurring transactions, index funds, term plans and small loans. The bank will provide only index funds in the mutual fund space to avoid misselling. In insurance, the bank will sell term plans but not endowment plans. Edited excerpts from an interview:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;who-is-your-target-customer-how-do-you-plan-to-roll-out-business-across-the-country&#34;&gt;Who is your target customer? How do you plan to roll out business across the country?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are targeting three segments with a bottom-up approach. The first is the 250 million people who don’t have mobile phones and are typically the DBT (direct benefits transfer) beneficiaries. The second is the middle layer, the 500 million people who have feature phones. In terms of products, the focus will be on recurring expenditure such as school fees, electricity bills, phone bills, healthcare expenditure and conveyance. If you look at state transport corporations, the transactions are all cash-based. We want to introduce electronic payment in remittances. We are also targeting “unreserved” railway ticketing. The third segment is the 250 million smartphone users. We will simplify a lot of payments which are common for both smartphone as well as feature phone users. Additionally, we plan to offer very simple third-party products such as life insurance, equity products and credit largely based on smart analytics. That is how we plan to cover the entire spectrum. The focus will be on payment solutions and not on banking solutions. Every household has a bank account. The way the regulator has structured the business of a payments bank is that there is no skin in float. So we are going to make a living out of transactions. Within this space, our private sector competitors will be looking at all kinds of applications in the private sector. We will typically focus on the government and public sector undertakings space where we have natural affinity in terms of being an acceptable payment service provider. We have a commitment that by September-end access points in post offices across the country should go live.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-kind-of-third-party-products-do-you-plan-to-offer-how-will-you-ensure-there-is-no-misselling-will-you-have-exclusive-partners-for-third-party-products&#34;&gt;What kind of third-party products do you plan to offer? How will you ensure there is no misselling? Will you have exclusive partners for third-party products?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We would largely look at mutual funds. Within mutual funds, probably just index funds because I don’t have a sophisticated sales force. Also, I don’t think I have a sophisticated customer and we don’t want to missell. We will go to the market and make initial forays with standard and simple products. In insurance, we are interested only in pure life term insurance and nothing else. Life insurance companies’ core competence is insuring and not necessarily investments. In terms of making a correct sell, it is very simple for me to deal with my customers and tell “look, what we are proposing is a life cover: nothing less, nothing more”. For everything that we do, there are two non-negotiables: one is competition and other is choice. If we are going to take on any service, including a third-party product, it has to be on competitive basis. And my customers will always get a choice. We will deal with organizations on a non-exclusive basis. I will do some simple standardizations For instance, in case of life insurance, it will be group insurance because that is where I can negotiate the best rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-kind-of-loan-products-will-you-offer&#34;&gt;What kind of loan products will you offer?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Credit will take some time because an analytics engine has to be put in place based on transaction history of our customers. We will have to work with a third party for a format to offer instant unsecured loans. We will be looking at small-ticket loans. For instance, if an account holder comes to the post office and needs a Rs20,000 loan, we should be able to given him this at a click of a button. I should be able to tell him these are the five providers who are willing to offer it with terms and conditions. We will simplify and standardize it. The guy can take a pick, we disburse it and take a mandate for EMI (equated monthly instalment).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;you-have-partnered-with-punjab-national-bank-how-will-this-help-you&#34;&gt;You have partnered with Punjab National Bank. How will this help you?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Punjab National Bank is helping us on interim technology solutions. We will be happy to dispense their products within the framework that we intend to operate. Everything is on a non-exclusive basis. Nobody has a head-start and nobody is a laggard. When I say interim technology, a standard CBS (core banking solution) is not really designed for high volume payment transactions. We are just using Punjab National Bank’s platform to test the technology with our kind of customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;compared-to-airtel-payments-bank-you-offer-a-lower-interest-rate-on-savings-deposit&#34;&gt;Compared to Airtel Payments Bank, you offer a lower interest rate on savings deposit.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can only largely invest in government securities. Currently they give you about 6.1% before tax. I am not in a position to give anything higher than that for sure. Any economics beyond that does beat us but we don’t levy transaction charges on our customers for deposits. Charges are for door-to-door transactions. Other payments banks are taking a transaction fee. Ultimately, no corporate pays from its pocket. There are no free lunches. Either you levy an upfront charge or you do it on whatever other way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;how-do-plan-to-train-your-employees-to-provide-digital-services&#34;&gt;How do plan to train your employees to provide digital services?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am afraid that they can’t do anything complicated. And that is why I intend to use Aadhaar (the unique ID dispensed by the Unique Identification Authority of India). Biometrics enabled transaction is the only thing that will work. I just have to keep it simple which is also an operational necessity. Simplicity hurts no one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;do-you-plan-to-tie-up-with-fintech-companies-for-payment-solutions&#34;&gt;Do you plan to tie up with fintech companies for payment solutions?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think we will have to reach out to fin-tech companies while having sufficiently enabled in-house ability to deal with technology. The plan is to use open systems, APIs (application protocol interfaces; essentially bits of software that can fit right into larger programs), developing apps with the help of trusted partners and developers and opening the payments space for whoever needs it. We don’t need a lot of partners but (need) the right one.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Govt says Aadhaar a must for labourers to avail benefits</title>
      <link>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/govt-says-aadhaar-must-labourers-avail-benefits/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;labour department has made Aadhaar card and self declaration form compulsory for the labourers at the time of registration to avail benefits under Building and Other Construction Workers (BOCW) Board schemes.The move is aimed to check duplicity and prevent dual distribution of benefits among beneficiaries. The decision was taken in a recent meeting held this month at Chandigarh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The meeting was chaired by labour commissioner Tajinder Singh Dhaliwal and a direction regarding the same was issued to all the assistant labour commissioners (ALC) across the state on Friday. As per the directions, the labour commissioners have been asked to mention Aadhaar card details of the beneficiary and family members along with a self-declaration form mentioning that other family members of the beneficiary will not take benefits of labour schemes after him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The move is aimed to check duplicity and prevent dual distribution of benefits among beneficiaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decision was taken in a recent meeting held this month at Chandigarh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The meeting was chaired by labour commissioner Tajinder Singh Dhaliwal and a direction regarding the same was issued to all the assistant labour commissioners (ALC) across the state on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As per the directions, the labour commissioners have been asked to mention Aadhaar card details of the beneficiary and family members along with a self-declaration form mentioning that other family members of the beneficiary will not take benefits of labour schemes after him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The move came after some complaints of dual benefits under various schemes were availed by many persons of a single family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under BOCW Act provisions for registration of four family members of the beneficiary can be submitted to the board but only one member can claim the benefits on behalf of the family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sources said that in some cases beneficiary and his wife as a member have claimed benefits under Shagun Scheme separately as earlier, there was no check on the number of claimants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Now, each beneficiary has to submit details in an amendment forum about the Aadhaar card and family members’ detail declaring that no other member of his family will take same benefits from the labour department,” assistant labour commissioner Sukhjinder Singh said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;boosting-workers-registration&#34;&gt;BOOSTING WORKERS’ REGISTRATION&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concerning low registration of workers with board, labour department has also asked its officials to paste a list of all the registering labour officers with their name, contact number at the notice board of labour department.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While, contact details with complete information of PWD and other department officers, who registered construction workers with board, have been asked to display in their district labour departments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dhaliwal said that many workers are still not aware from where they can get registered so all the officers, workers, trade union workers and NGOs can be directly approached for registration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As per the information, state labour department has managed to register about 5.61 lakh workers till December 31, even the estimated figures are said to be over 20 lakhs in the state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The labour department is not able to utilise funds collected in lieu of cess in the state as labour department has collected about Rs 921.75 crore cess amount and spent about Rs 335.99 crore towards the distribution of benefits to beneficiaries and other administrative expenses till the end of 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The board earns its revenue from the ‘welfare cess’, 1% of the total cost of construction projects which are worth Rs 10 lakh or more, which is submitted to the labour department to utilise the labour schemes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Labour department has also faced wrath of the Punjab and Haryana high court in past due to its slow utilisation of welfare funds.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Aadhaar not compulsory for obtaining marriage certificate: CIC to Govt</title>
      <link>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/aadhaar-not-compulsory-obtaining-marriage-certificate-cic-govt/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;The Chief Information Commission has asked the government and marriage registration authorities to raise awareness and provide publicity through various media that Aadhaar is not compulsory for the purpose of marriage registration scheme, reports LiveLaw.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The commission ruled that the compulsory registration of marriages helps tackle various issues like child marriage, marriage without consent, bigamous marriages, etc., and as such, the government should make it easier and more convenient to facilitate the registration, by not requiring other documents like Aadhaar and making changes for online application for marriage under the Special Marriage Act etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CIC cited Supreme Court’s order from 2014, which ruled that the government should not restrict social benefits to those who are yet to receive their Aadhaar card. Last year, the SC had also said that the card scheme is purely voluntary and cannot be made mandatory for scholarships. However, contrary to its prior stance, the SC asked the Government to link all mobile numbers with Aadhaar card details within a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;centre-s-push-to-increase-aadhaar-saturation&#34;&gt;Centre’s push to increase Aadhaar saturation?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The usage of Aadhaar as a verification system has been on the rise where multiple services including the IIT JEE, employee provident funds, PDS food grain purchases, RTE admissions and Jharkhand’s food and public distribution systems also using it. Private companies have also started using Aadhaar for verification purposes, such as iris scans by DCB Bank for eKYC, Microsoft’s Skype Lite which supports Aadhaar based verification, etc. However, use of Aadhaar by making it compulsory to avail some services, has come under heavy criticism for not respecting user privacy or being very secure.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Axis Bank case: To make Aadhaar safe, encryption devices coming soon, more in store</title>
      <link>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/axis-bank-case-make-aadhaar-safe-encryption-devices-coming-soon-store/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Even Aadhaar sceptics would do well to keep in mind that, while a criminal complaint has been filed against Axis Bank, Suvidhaa Infoserve and eMudhra for allegedly storing biometrics.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even Aadhaar sceptics would do well to keep in mind that, while a criminal complaint has been filed against Axis Bank, Suvidhaa Infoserve and eMudhra for allegedly storing biometrics and using them in an unauthorised manner, it was UIDAI that discovered the irregular transactions and reported them to the Delhi Police’s cyber cell and, pending a probe, all transaction requests from these organisations have been put on hold. If the UIDAI system is able to detect fraud, as the banks did when they found millions of debit/credit cards had been compromised due to a faulty ‘switch’ in a payments&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;gateway some months ago in India, presumably that would mean it was working well.
Under normal circumstances, as a safety feature, every time a transaction is made like withdrawing funds from a bank and UIDAI replies to an authentication request, an SMS/email alert is sent to the subscriber.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, why didn’t UIDAI send out alerts this time around when, going by a report in The Times of India, one individual performed 397 transactions, many of which were based on biometrics that were ‘stored’ locally and bunched during one week in January? Is this an example of Aadhaar being open to&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;misuse since banks, etc, can store your biometrics and use them to illegally authorise transactions later? There have also been reports of one website publishing Aadhaar data of 500,000 minors—this, of course, is a list of names and matching Aadhaar numbers, but does not have actual biometrics—and of white-hat hackers generating iris scans from high-resolution photographs and even the possibility of data being compromised since Aadhaar registrations/verifications are typically done by several private firms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, as UIDAI officials point out, since the individual doing the transactions was using his own Aadhaar number, the alerts went to him—to that extent, the system’s first fail-safe worked. Had the stored biometrics belonged to someone else, say a reader of this newspaper, she would have got the&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SMS/email alerts and would have escalated matters. Two, since the authentication request, and the reply, are encrypted at a 2048-bit level—normal encryption levels are 128 or 256—UIDAI officials argue this makes the system very safe from hacking. But what of cases where the biometrics are stolen, or generated from high-resolution photographs, and then stored locally? Since security has to be an evolving feature, designed to beat threats as they occur or before they do, UIDAI plans to introduce the concept of ‘registered devices’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the last few months, UIDAI has been working with vendors of biometric-capture devices to get them to install an Aadhaar-encryption key in the hardware itself—among other things, it ensures the biometric data used is ‘captured live’ and is not stored data. Last month, it was notified that, after&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May, no data requests will be entertained if they come from ‘unregistered devices’—existing biometric devices, such as those in ration shops already, are to be upgraded through software right now and those bought in the future must have the necessary pre-installed keys. It is certain criminals will find smarter ways to beat the system, and UIDAI will have to keep evolving to heighten security—to the extent some beat the system, or try to, as happens in the case of bank frauds, the criminal justice system has to be used to punish them.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Is Your Aadhaar Biometrics Safe? Firms Accused Of Storing Biometrics And Using Them Illegally</title>
      <link>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/aadhaar-biometrics-safe-firms-accused-storing-biometrics-using-illegally/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Fears of Aadhar biometric security have been compounded as the government is sprinting towards the next phase of ‘cashless India’ and digitization&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest fear regarding misuse of Aadhar biometrics and security loopholes are becoming real.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three firms are being probed for attempting unauthorised authentication and impersonation by using stored Aadhaar biometrics, reported The Times of India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper reported that the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) has lodged a criminal complaint with the cyber cell of Delhi Police, saying it is a clear violation of the law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The firms are Axis Bank, Suvidhaa Infoserve and eMudhra. They have been served a “notice for action“ under Aadhaar regulations”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The firms have been accused of storing biometrics and using them illegally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fears of biometric security have been compounded as the government is sprinting towards the next phase of ‘cashless India’ and digitization. They are preparing to launch Aadhaar Pay, an initiative that will supersede the need to use credit cards, debit cards, smartphones and PINs to make payments or transfer money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposed system of payments will use a person’s biometric data and fingerprints to make payments through Aadhaar-linked bank accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outlook’s Senior Associate Editor Arindam Mukherjee had in a clairvoyant article for the magazine raised the fears of biometrics being manipulated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the article, critics of Aadhaar and Aadhaar-based services raised the issue of privacy and security of biometric and personal data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pranesh Prakash, policy director with the Centre for Internet and Society (CIS), ­rec­ently tweeted, “As long as Aadhar-Enabled Payment Services encourages biometric authorisation of transactions, it is bound to be a security nightmare, with widespread fraud.” Would you tell a shopkeeper your debit card’s PIN? No. Then why share your fingerprint? A fingerprint, in this system, becomes a kind of unchangeable Aadhaar Enabled Payment System PIN, he asks.
Pointing out a possible danger, Usha Ramanathan, an independent law resear­c­her who has been following Aadhaar since its inception, says, “In many ­payments, biometric data is authenticated and then it remains in the system where there are leakages. Intermediaries then have access to the data, which is thus made insecure.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the UIDAI, however, once biometric data is provided by the consumer while making Aadhaar-based payments, it gets encrypted and a merchant doesn’t get access to that data. The Aadhaar Act also prohibits any storing of biometric data in local devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet, there are many like CIS executive director Sunil Abraham who believe it is a mistake to use biometrics for authentication, especially when payments are concerned.
“Our concern with Aadhaar Pay is about the biometric component of the project,” says Abraham. “Biometrics is an identification technology. Unfortunately, it is being presented as an authentication technology. It is not a secure authentication technology as biometric data can be stolen easily. It is also irrevocable; once bio­metric data is stolen, it cannot be ­re-issued like a smart card.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there is the problem of availability of fingerprints. In the case of many people from rural areas and the working class, fingerprints get affected due to the manual nature of their work. This makes it difficult for this target group of UIDAI to conduct transactions properly through Aadhaar Pay. “In Rajasthan, 30 per cent of the households are not even able to procure ration using fingerprints,” says Ramanathan.&lt;/p&gt;
