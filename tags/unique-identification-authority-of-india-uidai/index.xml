      <guid>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/gst-how-it-impacts-you-in-10-points/</guid>
      <description>Here is a 10-point cheat-sheet
 The biggest game changer in GST is input tax credit, where credits of input taxes paid at each stage of production or service delivery can be availed in the succeeding stages of value addition. This means that the end consumer will thus only bear the GST charged by the last point in supply chain, with set-off benefits at all the earlier stages.
 To ensure that manufacturers and service providers pass on the benefit to the final customer, the government has included an anti-profiteering clause in the GST law.</description>

      <description>Compared to bank deposits or small savings, non-convertible debentures, liquid funds, tax-free bonds and company fixed deposits offer higher returns, albeit with some risks.
At a time when interest rates on bank deposit and small savings are falling, investors can look at other debt financial instruments to earn some higher returns.
Non-convertible debentures Companies issue non-convertible debentures (NCDs) to raise long-term funds. These debentures cannot be converted into shares or equities and lenders offer a higher rate of return compared to convertible debentures.</description>

      <description>Last year, Vijay Kumar, an Indian Army sepoy, got the shock of his life when he discovered a shortfall of Rs 2 lakh in his SBI salary account. Subsequently drawing out of transaction details and CCTV footage revealed Kumar’s card was “cloned” by fraudsters several kilometers from his base in Delhi Cantonment.
Kumar had never even travelled to Connaught Place where his card was used (or misused). Miscreants managed to get his bank details using a Malaysian-make card reader and a hidden camera (affixed to the ceiling of the rigged ATM, focused on the keypad) to capture the PIN.</description>

      <description>Right now, however, the government is grappling with a tricky issue: what to call the UID for cows? Monu says that for the time being, they are calling it “Aadhaar-like” (instead of Aadhaar) because some right-wing cows took exception to their UID number being referred to by the same name as “the despicable surveillance operation unleashed on humans”.
I confess I’m with the cows on this. There are sound reasons why the cow UID should not be referred to as Aadhaar.</description>
