      <title>EPFO Reduces Wait For Pension, Provident Fund Withdrawal To 10 days</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The retirement fund manager had launched an online claim settlement facility on May 1, 2017.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Retirement fund manager EPFO has reduced the stipulated period for settlement of various claims such PF withdrawal, pension and insurance to 10 days from 20 at present. In July 2015, the Employees&amp;rsquo; Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) had reduced the timeline for settling various claims to 20 day to improve the service delivery for its over four crore subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The body has launched the online claim settlement facility on May 1, 2017. It has planned to eventually settle claims of all Aadhaar and bank account seeded EPF accounts within three hours of receipt of an application. &amp;ldquo;The timeline in case of claim settlements is 10 days and 15 days in case of grievance redressal management,&amp;rdquo; an EPFO statement said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are new provisions in the EPFO&amp;rsquo;s Citizens&amp;rsquo; Charter 2017 launched in Bangalore today by Labour Minister Bandaru Dattatreya.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It said the Charter is an attempt to bring transparency and accountability on the part of EPFO and make service delivery system and grievance redressal mechanism more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EPFO e-court Management System has also been launched which is in tune with the vision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi of digital India. The objective of the project is a transparent and electronic case management system which will cater to aspirations of all stakeholders - the employers, the employees, litigants and CBT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a step towards paperless court system wherein court procedure of EPF &amp;amp; MP Act, 1952 and EPFAT (tribunal) will take place in a digital environment. Further, in order to facilitate easy access to the tribunal, automated messages will be sent to the litigants on their registered mobile numbers on the status of their cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stakeholders can also track the individual cases online, it said. Now the parties can file all their paper/evidence/ documents online and all the details alongwith status can be accessed online. Updation is an important part of e-court management system in which digital case record will create a digital database which can be utilised to generate meaningful and accurate reports, it said.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>GST impact: here’s how much it may cost you</title>
      <link>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/gst-impact-services-set-to-get-costlier-heres-how-much-it-may-cost-you/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Among the 120 services that are currently being taxed, a vast majority is likely to come under the goods and services tax (GST) slab of 18%, while a clutch of them including air travel services, renting of hotels, restaurants and other “bundled” food supply services could get taxed at 12%. A handful of services including transport of goods by road (trucks) and rail and financial leasing including hire purchase could fall under the lowest GST rate of 5%. While the principle that underlies the GST rates fitment, recommended by a committee of officials, is to minimise rate shocks, services would still be the category to witness rate hikes the most as the country adopts the new indirect tax structure, official sources said. Since the current service tax rate is 15% (including the 0.5% Swachh Bharat Cess and an equal Krishi Kalyan cess), levy of GST at 18% would mean a significant increase in the tax liability of consumers of most services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even for the relatively smaller number of services to be taxed at 12% in the GST regime, the tax incidence could actually increase in some cases. This is because taxes paid after the abatements permitted by the government work out to be lower than 12% in many such cases at present. For example, restaurant services are currently taxed with 30% abatement, which means actual tax incidence of 10.5%. This could increase to 12% in the GST regime, rather than decrease to 5%. The sources added that all the 60-odd exempt services, which are on the negative list now, would be outside the GST net too. These include services provided by educational institutions, healthcare services, EPFO- Irdai-Sebi services, non-A/c restaurants etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, since the service providers will get greater opportunity to avail of input tax credit in the GST regime, their tax liability could soften if a rate hike is big enough to offset it. Transport of goods by rail is now taxed after 70% abatement on the condition that CENVAT credit has not been taken by the businesses concerned. Since the credit flows will be more efficient in the GST regime, the tax rate is likely to be fixed taking into account the abatements being given now for the new regime to be rate-neutral.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, at least in some cases, this principle might not be followed and the tax liability of businesses and consumers could rise, analysts said. However, the instances of GST leading to higher tax liabilities and price increases will be very few in the case of goods. Items constituting half of the consumer price index (CPI) basket including food grain will be exempt from GST; many other goods of mass consumption, together another tenth of the basket, will be taxed at a benign 5%; a quarter of the basket will come under either 12% or 18%, the two “standard rates.
The government has maintained that rate fitment will be a “mechanical (rather than discretionary) exercise” as the process has taken into account the real tax incidence at present rather than the nominal rate. For instance, if the nominal tax rate on an item with maximum retail price of Rs 150 and ex-factory price of Rs 100 is 26.5% (12.5% excise and 14% VAT), the real tax incidence on the price to the consumer is just 22%, as the excise duty is virtually levied on the ex-factory price, with abatement for post-manufacturing value addition. Chances are that the item will come under 18% GST, rather than the highest rate of 28%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The committee of officials has prepared a detailed document on the fitment of GST rates for the consideration of the GST Council. The 800-page document is likely to be vetted by the council as it meets in Srinagar on May 18-19. Source told FE that even after the GST Council approval, the rates will be notified and made public only closer to the July 1 roll-out to avoid market distortion and hoarding. Experts said that the reason for delaying announcement of rates could be to negate the possibility that a manufacturer may ramp up or slow down production till July 1 if it’s known that a commodity will be taxed at a lower/ higher rate under GST.
Apart from final approval to the rates, the GST Council is expected to okay the five draft rules related to accounts and records, advance ruling, appeals and revision, assessment and audit and e-way bill. So far, the Council has approved nine GST rules in its earlier meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to choose the right credit card: 6 power points to note</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Opt for a credit card whose benefits in the form of cashbacks, discounts, reward points and lifestyle programmes outweigh the various mandatory fees associated with it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Credit cards today have become an integral part of our lives. They save us from the hassles of carrying cash, allow us to optimise our finances better through interest-free periods and EMI options, enable us to maintain a good credit score and avail attractive cashbacks, discounts and reward points offered by banks. However, with several types of credit cards available in the market, choosing the right one can be confusing for a customer. Here are some factors to be considered while selecting a credit card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;spending-habits&#34;&gt;Spending habits&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most credit cards aim at specific type of transactions by offering higher reward points and other benefits on those transactions. For example, while some cards offer cashback on fuel transactions or other daily spends, others offer more reward points on air travels, dining and/or hotel stays. Choose a card that will offer you maximum benefits, according to your lifestyle and spending habits. For example, if you travel a lot, take a credit card that offers travel benefits like air miles, lounge access and hotel vouchers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;fees&#34;&gt;Fees&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Credit card issuers charge various types of fees for their services, like joining fee, annual fee, rewards redemption fee, late payment fee and cash advance fee. The joining and annual fee usually ranges between Rs 199–5,000 depending on the card category. However, many card issuers do not charge joining fee and/or annual fee. Many cards also waive off their joining fee on applying through online loan aggregators while others reverse their annual and joining fee on spending a threshold amount through their credit cards. Opt for a credit card whose benefits in the form of cashbacks, discounts, reward points and lifestyle programmes outweigh the various mandatory fees associated with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;also-watch&#34;&gt;Also Watch:&lt;/h1&gt;


&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; padding-top: 30px; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/FGMeZGdYUXo&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;&#34; allowfullscreen frameborder=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h1 id=&#34;credit-limit&#34;&gt;Credit limit&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Credit limit refers to the maximum amount that you can spend on your card without incurring any penalty. Exceeding this limit results in incurring an over limit fee on the amount exceeded. Thus, opt for a card that offers at least 3–4 times of your tentative monthly credit card spends. Also, remember that having a higher credit limit will come in handy during financial emergencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;joining-bonuses&#34;&gt;Joining bonuses&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many credit cards, especially in the premium and travel segments, offer attractive joining bonuses or welcome benefits in the form of free vouchers and additional bonus reward points. Many card issuers also offer exclusive joining bonuses on applying through online aggregators. Compare the joining bonuses among similar cards before zeroing on a particular option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;finance-charges&#34;&gt;Finance charges&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Card issuers levy finance charges on non-payment or part-payment of outstanding balance by the due date and on cash withdrawals. This charge is levied right from the date of the transaction until the repayment of the entire outstanding. The finance charge can vary from 22–47% per annum depending on your card type. Though not paying your entire credit card bill on time or withdrawing cash using your credit card is never recommended, you should still consider these charges when applying for a credit card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;credit-score&#34;&gt;Credit score&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The approval of your credit card application primarily depends on your credit score, monthly income and occupational details. Each bank gives different weightage to these parameters. However, people with credit scores of 750 and above have higher chances of getting their credit card approved.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Indian-Origin Techie Links Ransomware Attack To North Korea</title>
      <link>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/indian-origin-techie-links-ransomware-attack-to-north/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 17 May 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/indian-origin-techie-links-ransomware-attack-to-north/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;About 200,000 machines have been infected worldwide by the ransomware &amp;ldquo;WannaCry&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An Indian-origin security researcher with Google has found evidence suggesting that North Korean hackers may have carried out the &amp;ldquo;unprecedented&amp;rdquo; ransomware cyberattack that hit over 150 countries, including India. Neel Mehta has published a code which a Russian security firm has termed as the &amp;ldquo;most significant clue to date&amp;rdquo;, BBC reported today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The code, published on Twitter, is exclusive to North Korean hackers, researchers said. Researchers have said that some of the code used in Friday&amp;rsquo;s ransomware, known as WannaCry software, was nearly identical to the code used by the Lazarus Group, a group of North Korean hackers who used a similar version for the devastating hack of Sony Pictures Entertainment in 2014 and the last year&amp;rsquo;s hack of Bangladesh Central Bank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Security experts are now cautiously linking the Lazarus Group to this latest attack after the discovery by Mehta. Mehta has found similarities between code found within WannaCry and other tools believed to have been created by the Lazarus Group in the past, BBC reported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Security expert Prof Alan Woodward said that time stamps within the original WannaCry code are set to UTC +9 - China&amp;rsquo;s time zone - and the text demanding the ransom uses what reads like machine-translated English, but a Chinese segment apparently written by a native speaker, the report said.
&amp;ldquo;As you can see it is pretty thin and all circumstantial. However, it is worth further investigation,&amp;rdquo; Woodward said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Neel Mehta&amp;rsquo;s discovery is the most significant clue to date regarding the origins of WannaCry,&amp;rdquo; said Russian security firm Kaspersky, but noted a lot more information is needed about earlier versions of WannaCry before any firm conclusion can be reached, it reported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We believe it is important that other researchers around the world investigate these similarities and attempt to discover more facts about the origin of WannaCry,&amp;rdquo; it said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attributing cyberattacks can be notoriously difficult-often relying on consensus rather than confirmation, the report said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea has never admitted any involvement in the Sony Pictures hack - and while security researchers, and the US government, have confidence in the theory, neither can rule out the possibility of a false flag, it said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Skilled hackers may have simply made it look like it had origins in North Korea by using similar techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of WannaCry, it is possible that hackers simply copied code from earlier attacks by the Lazarus Group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of ifs in there. It wouldn&amp;rsquo;t stand up in court as it is. But it&amp;rsquo;s worth looking deeper, being conscious of confirmation bias now that North Korea has been identified as a possibility,&amp;rdquo; Woodward said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the strongest theory yet as to the origin of WannaCry, but there are also details that arguably point  way from it being the work of North Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, China was among the countries worst hit, and not accidentally - the hackers made sure there was a version of the ransom note written in Chinese. It seems unlikely North Korea would want to antagonise its strongest ally. Russia too was badly affected, the report said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, North Korean cyber-attacks have typically been far more targeted, often with a political goal in mind. In the case of Sony Pictures, hackers sought to prevent the release of The Interview, a film that mocked North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un. WannaCry, in contrast, was wildly indiscriminate - it would infect anything and everything it could, the report said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, if the plan was simply to make money, it&amp;rsquo;s been pretty unsuccessful on that front too - only around $60,000 has been paid in ransoms, according to analysis of Bitcoin accounts being used by the criminals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With more than 200,000 machines infected, it&amp;rsquo;s a terrible return, the report said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Friday, Europol Director Rob Wainwright said, &amp;ldquo;The global reach is unprecedented. The latest count is over 200,000 victims in at least 150 countries and those victims many of those will be businesses including large corporations&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most disruptive attacks were reported in the UK, where hospitals and clinics were forced to turn away patients after losing access to computers.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Not happy with bank fixed deposits? Check out 4 alternatives</title>
      <link>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/not-happy-with-bank-fixed-deposits-check-out-4-alternatives/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Compared to bank deposits or small savings, non-convertible debentures, liquid funds, tax-free bonds and company fixed deposits offer higher returns, albeit with some risks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a time when interest rates on bank deposit and small savings are falling, investors can look at other debt financial instruments to earn some higher returns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;non-convertible-debentures&#34;&gt;Non-convertible debentures&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies issue non-convertible debentures (NCDs) to raise long-term funds. These debentures cannot be converted into shares or equities and lenders offer a higher rate of return compared to convertible debentures. Non-convertible debentures are of two types —secured and non-secured. The secured ones are backed by assets, wherein if the company is unable to fulfil its obligations, the assets are liquidated to repay the investors.
So, secured non-convertible debentures pay lower coupons than non-secured ones. Companies issuing non-convertible debentures offer higher rates because they carry default risk compared to bank or postal deposits. Investing in NCDs makes sense for those in the 10% to 20% tax brackets, as those in the lowest tax bracket can get post tax returns around 7% for a 120-month tenure. One should invest in non-convertible debentures only if he can hold them till maturity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#Liquid funds&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors can also look at liquid funds offered by asset management companies for short-term investment for up to a year. The fund will yield marginally higher returns than bank deposits. Moreover, they are as liquid as time and demand deposits as the market regulator has allowed fund houses to offer instant redemption facility of up to Rs 50,000. In fact, one aspect where bank deposits scored over liquid funds or any other money market funds was same day redemption.
Now that has been taken care and investors can manage cash flows better. At the time of investing in debt funds, investors must analyse the credit rating of the bonds in which the fund house invests. While debt funds are not rated, their safety can be analysed from the portfolio they invest in. Fund managers may sometimes take higher position in bonds with lower rating for higher returns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#Tax-free bonds&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the name suggests, tax-free bonds were issued by state-owned companies such as NHAI, IRFC, HUDCO till March 2016. However, investors can now buy these bonds from the secondary market and can earn up to 2% more than bank fixed deposits after tax. Tax-free bonds are an attractive long-term investment as there is no deduction of tax at source from the interest that accrues to bondholders, irrespective of the interest amount or status of the investor.
These bonds score over fixed deposits or other debt investment as investors do not have to pay tax on the returns. Before investing in tax-free bonds, one must look at the issue size as it may impact liquidity. For instance, NHAI’s Rs 10,000-crore bond issue has the highest traded volume on bourses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;company-fixed-deposits&#34;&gt;Company fixed deposits&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even by investing in company fixed deposits of top-rated firms, investors can earn up to 150 basis points more than bank fixed deposits. However, investors must exercise utmost caution because while bank deposits provide security for investment up to Rs 1 lakh, this is not the case with corporate fixed deposits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tenure of company deposits ranges from one to seven years and one can earn compounding interest by reinvesting the principal amount along with the interest earned. Investors can get direct ECS credit facility for interest payments or advance interest warrants for the year. However, unless one needs income regularly, they should prefer cumulative schemes to regular income options since the interest earned gets reinvested at the same coupon rate, resulting in better yields.
Diversify investment in four to five companies and avoid investing in those companies that mention very high interest rates and whose balance sheets show losses. If one invests in a company that is low on ratings, go for a short tenure, which will enable you to opt out if the company is not performing well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Post notes ban, there has been a hike in collection of personal income tax, the finance minister said, adding that the new portal will help honest tax payer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;HIGHLIGHTS&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finance Minister says number of assessees has gone up post notes ban&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Personal income tax collection has gone up post notes ban, he adds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mr Jaitley expects further increase in tax returns going ahead&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number of persons under the tax net has increased by 91 lakh as unaccounted cash lost anonymity post note ban, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Launching a new website on &amp;lsquo;Operation Clean Money&amp;rsquo;, a programme to bring illegal wealth on books, he said the fallout of the November 8 decision to demonetise higher denomination currency has increased movement towards digitisation, number of assessees going up and tax revenue jumping as also fear of dealing in cash being instilled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stating that as many as 91 lakh persons have come under the tax net, Jaitley said he expects further increase in tax returns going ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Post demonetisation, there has been a hike in collection of personal income tax, the finance minister said, adding that the new portal will help honest tax payer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CBDT Chairman Sushil Chandra said there was 22 per cent growth in e-filed returns post demonetisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As many as 17.92 lakh people were identified for unexplained deposits post demonetisation, he said, adding the tax department has identified one lakh suspected tax avoidance cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He also said that an undisclosed income of Rs 16,398 crore was identified post demonetisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We identified around 17.92 lakh persons in whose case the cash transactions did not appear in line with the taxpayers&amp;rsquo; profiles. And online verifications of these transactions are underway,&amp;rdquo; Chandra said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the 17.92 lakh, so far 9.72 lakh individuals responded to SMSes and e-mails sent by the income tax department.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>WannaCry ransomware : 48,000 attempts in India, says Quick Heal</title>
      <link>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/wannacry-in-india/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 17 May 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/wannacry-in-india/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;While organisations and networks in over 150 countries were crippled by the WannaCry ransomware outbreak, India escaped from the malware spreading and causing damage, thanks to the timing of the incident, with offices being shut during the weekend.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While organisations and networks in over 150 countries were crippled by the WannaCry ransomware outbreak, India escaped from the malware spreading and causing damage, thanks to the timing of the incident, with offices being shut during the weekend. By Monday morning, everybody had become alert and it averted a lot of damage, Sanjay Katkar, MD and CTO of Quick Heal Technologies, an IT security solutions provider, said. Since Monday, Quick Heal has been receiving distress calls from customers but it was not clear whether they were affected or not, as this was not being disclosed by those calling, Katkar said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quick Heal detected over 48,000 attempts of WannaCry ransomware attack in India. Kolkata tops the list of cities with maximum detections, followed by Delhi, Bhubaneswar, Pune and Mumbai. The top five states with maximum detections are West Bengal, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Delhi (including NCR) and Odisha. Among the attempted attacks, 60% were targeted towards enterprises and 40% towards individual customers. In case of an attack, Katkar advises companies or users not to pay any ransom as this would go in funding the next attack.
“Hackers who are successful in collecting money will re-invest into new technologies. People who pay are funding the next attack,” warns Katkar. Protection was available if the users updated the anti-virus software and the patch was made available on March ’17 but many did not update their systems, Katkar said. Soon after the ransomware attack was spotted, Quick Heal Security Labs issued an advisory informing customer on ways to reduce the risk of infection by&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WannaCry Ransomware. Quick Heal has also organized a webinar to educate businesses on how to protect their organization from the WannaCry Ransomware on Wednesday, May 17 at 4 pm. This kind of an incident helps increase awareness about security but their experience was that people go back to business as usual in quick time, says Katkar. This threat indicates people not serious about security but security has to be priority if they want to protect data, he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outdated operating system and failure to use anti-virus software makes them vulnerable, he said. Some of the software in the enterprise could be running on older systems especially in the manufacturing sector and a shift would need upgrading hardware so they could be continuing with old systems, Katkar said. Banks in the country that have outsourced some of their systems/ functions to third-party service providers need to take a re-look at the security at their vendors especially their ATM networks, he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The retail user are also casual so vulnerability is more on this front. A lot of data moving on the mobile phones and people are connected &lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; on the net but the market is not keen on paying for security their phones so mobile security is not picking up, Katkar said. “Given their profitability, ransomware attacks are predicted to increase in the coming quarter. There can be a drastic increase in the number of Locky samples being distributed via spam emails or exploits. Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) type attacks may increase due to its user friendliness,” a Quick Heal Security Labs Q12017 threat report had warned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;here-is-a-list-of-do-s-and-don-ts-which-you-should-follow-to-keep-your-computer-safe&#34;&gt;Here is a list of Do’s and Don’ts which you should follow to keep your computer safe:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You need to immediately install the May Windows Update bundles. Shutting down your system for a few minutes will be worth it, if it enables you to avoid this. If you’re still using Windows XP, you’re out of luck, but the March and April update bundles are available for Windows Vista. Also, Microsoft has released a patch for Windows XP and its server counterpart Windows 2003.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In order to prevent the infection, users and organisations should apply relevant patches to Windows systems as mentioned in the Microsoft Security Bulletin MS17-010. The malware has been targeting commonly used office file extensions such as .ppt (PowerPoint), .doc and .docx (Word), .xlsx (Excel), and image file extensions such as .tiff, .raw, among various other common file types for archiving, emails, databases, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This attack type may evolve over time, so any additional defense-in-depth strategies will provide additional protections. (For example, to further protect against SMBv1 attacks, customers should consider blocking legacy protocols on their networks).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As part of the best practices to prevent ransomware attacks, users should maintain an updated antivirus software, regularly check for integrity of the information stored on databases, to not open attachments in unsolicited e-mails, restrict users’ ability to install and run unwanted software applications, among various others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Individuals or organisations are not encouraged to pay the ransom, as this does not guarantee files will be released. Report such instances of fraud to CERT-In and law enforcement agencies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform regular backups of all critical information to limit the impact of data or system loss and to help expedite the recovery process. Ideally, this data should be kept on a separate device, and backups should be stored offline.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CERT-In advisory: Block SMB ports on Enterprise Edge/perimeter network devices [UDP 137, 138 and TCP 139, 445] or Disable SMBv1. &lt;a href=&#34;http://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2696547&#34;&gt;http://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2696547&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t open attachments in unsolicited e-mails, even if they come from people in your contact list, and never click on a URL contained in an unsolicited e-mail, even if the link seems benign. In cases of genuine URLs close out the e-mail and go to the organisation’s website directly through browser&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deploy web and email filters on the network. Configure these devices to scan for known bad domains, sources, and addresses; block these before receiving and downloading messages. Scan all emails, attachments, and downloads both on the host and at the mail gateway with a reputable antivirus solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;USE THESE TOOLS:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tool (NoMoreCry) to prevent Wannacry Ransomware by CCN-CERT:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sophos: Hitman.Pro&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Malwarebytes Anti-Ransomware(formally Crypto Monitor)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Aadhaar mandatory to avoid fake PAN cards: Government tells Supreme Court</title>
      <link>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/aadhaar-mandatory-to-avoid-fake-pan-cards-government/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 15 May 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/aadhaar-mandatory-to-avoid-fake-pan-cards-government/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The government today defended in the Supreme Court its decisionto make Aadhaar mandatory for issuing of PAN cards, saying it was done to curb the use of fake PAN cards across the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attorney General (AG) Mukul Rohatgi told a bench comprising Justices A K Sikri and Ashok Bhushan that the programme of PAN had become suspect as it could be faked while Aadhaar is a &amp;ldquo;secure and robust&amp;rdquo; system by which the identity of an individual cannot be faked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AG said that due to Aadhaar, government has saved over Rs 50,000 crore on the schemes to benefit the poor as well as the pension schemes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said that around 10 lakh PAN cards have been cancelled, while out of the 113.7 crore Aadhaar cards issued, no case of duplication has been found by the government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He also said that Aadhaar was an effective tool to check the menace of terror funding and circulation of black money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The idea behind Aadhaar is to make a secure and robust system by which the identity of a person cannot be faked,&amp;rdquo; the Attorney General told the court, which would continue hearing the arguments tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The apex court is hearing three petitions challenging the constitutional validity of Section 139 AA of the Income Tax Act which was introduced through the latest budget and the Finance Act 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Section 139AA provides for mandatory quoting of Aadhaar or enrolment ID of Aadhaar application form for filing of income tax returns and making an application for allotment of PAN number with effect from July 1 this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Senior counsel Shyam Divan, representing the petitioners, had earlier argued that section 139AA was unconstitutional and was in &amp;ldquo;direct collision&amp;rdquo; with the Aadhaar Act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He had also contended that there was no question of forcing a person to give his consent for Aadhaar and this was an issue which &amp;ldquo;alters the relationship of Republic of India with its citizens&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The petitioner had also argued that a law-abiding tax payer cannot be forced to give his Aadhaar number while filing income tax returns and this was like an &amp;ldquo;electronic leash&amp;rdquo; as government would be able to keep a tab on its citizens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Nowhere in the world there is such a biometric system which can track a person 24X7. They (government) are doing it even before the age of consent,&amp;rdquo; he had said during the arguments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The apex court had earlier put a poser as to why there was no objection from the lawmakers on the government&amp;rsquo;s decision to make Aadhaar mandatory for making PAN cards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rohatgi had also clarified that nowhere in section 139AA of IT Act, was it mentioned that it would be effective with retrospective effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government had earlier told the apex court that fake PAN cards were being used to &amp;ldquo;divert funds&amp;rdquo; to shell companies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>All Mobile Users Will Have To Go For Aadhar Verification Soon, Says Industry Body</title>
      <link>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/all-mobile-users-will-have-to-go-for-aadhar-verification-soon/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 15 May 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/all-mobile-users-will-have-to-go-for-aadhar-verification-soon/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Supreme Court, in an order in February this year, had observed that, &amp;ldquo;an effective process has been evolved to ensure the identity verification, as well as, the addresses of all mobile phone subscribers for the new subscribers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All existing subscribers of mobile services will have to go for Aadhaar-based re-verification soon, with the government instructing telecom operators to initiate the process. Cellular operators&amp;rsquo; body COAI said its members may meet this week to discuss the modalities of rolling out the verification process for the existing one billion-plus mobile phone users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip;all licensees shall re-verify all existing mobile subscribers (pre-paid and post-paid) through Aadhaar-based eKYC process&amp;hellip;,&amp;rdquo; a notification issued by the telecom department said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It further added that all licensees will have to inform existing subscribers &amp;ndash; through advertisements in print and electronic media as well as SMS &amp;ndash; about the order of the Supreme Court for re- verification activity. They have also been asked to upload the details of the exercise on their website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court, in an order in February this year, had observed that, &amp;ldquo;an effective process has been evolved to ensure the identity verification, as well as, the addresses of all mobile phone subscribers for the new subscribers. In the near future, and more particularly within one year from today, a similar verification will be completed, in case of existing subscribers&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The telecom department has said the operators will use and share common device eco-system through mutual agreements, and will work out mechanisms to avoid public inconvenience and long queues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When contacted, cellular operators association COAI said that the industry supported the move, but pointed out that the entire exercise will cost Rs. 1,000 crore for infrastructure and training, which will have to be borne by the operators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The issue of fake subscribers will go away. We will try our best to cover the entire base within the stipulated timeframe of one year but in case we cannot, we may ask DoT for an extension,&amp;rdquo; COAI Director General Rajan Mathews said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For re-verification through Aadhaar-based eKYC process, the operator will send a verification code to the mobile number of the subscriber. Prior to starting the eKYC, the operator will verify this code from the subscriber so as to confirm the SIM card of the mobile connection is physically available with the subscriber.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;After the completion of the eKYC process, before updating or overwriting the old subscriber detail in database with the data received through eKYC process, the licensee will seek confirmation from the subscriber about the re-verification of his/her mobile number after 24 hours through SMS,&amp;rdquo; the notification said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The operator can re-verify more than one mobile connection in one service area through a single eKYC but not bulk connections. For issuing additional mobile connections to re-verified subscriber, the operator would have to follow a separate eKYC process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verification of a subscriber would not be required in case of conversions - that is pre-paid to postpaid connections or vice versa, it clarified.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Link Aadhaar number with bank accounts</title>
      <link>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/link-aadhaar-number-bank-accounts/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Account holders with banks have been asked to link their accounts with their Aadhaar number and also provide mobile phone number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lead Bank Manager A. Sakthivel held a discussion with the representatives of all banks here on Monday to encourage their customers to provide the Aadhaar number and mobile phone numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A communication from the Union Finance Ministry said that only 44 per cent of the bank customers had provided their Aadhaar numbers. Similarly, the banks have mobile numbers of only 75 per cent of their account holders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aadhaar numbers are mandatory for digital transactions. Hence, the customers had been asked to provide a self-attested photocopy of Aadhar card with their mobile number and account number, said Mr. Sakthivel.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>You can now lock your Aadhaar data to keep it safe from hackers</title>
      <link>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/can-now-lock-aadhaar-data-keep-safe-hackers/</link>

      <guid>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/can-now-lock-aadhaar-data-keep-safe-hackers/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Now, you can lock your Aadhaar biometric details to keep it safe and unlock it whenever you want to use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With digital payments using Aadhaar data on the rise and cases of misuse being reported, officials of the &lt;em&gt;Unique Identification Authority of India&lt;/em&gt; (UIDAI) have come out with the new security feature to lock the biometric details (fingerprint and retinal scan data).The UIDAI introduced the lock and unlock facility following an uproar that Aadhaar deprived people of their right to privacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biometric data of citizens is being collected on various platforms for government schemes, often without much safeguards. Aadhaar identification has become almost compulsory in some cases. Banks, mobile phone operators and others have access to it. “People can hack into this data and access individuals’ details, including bank accounts,” a UIDAI official warned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Each time you shop and pay using your fingerprint, the data processed by POS machines can be hacked. Fingerprint details can be captured as well,” the official said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lock and unlock facility is purely voluntary. “If a person wants to lock his data, he or she can do it. No other person can unlock it. One can keep it locked as long as one wishes,” the official said Once the Aadhaar data is locked, even banks cannot access the biometric information stored in the main server.This will lead to failed transactions due to non-verification or non-authentication of the Aadhaar. The UIDAI is also planning to introduce a mobile application to lockunlock biometric data.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Aadhaar cards for kids now made easy by govt</title>
      <link>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/aadhaar-cards-kids-now-made-easy-govt/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 10 May 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/aadhaar-cards-kids-now-made-easy-govt/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Worried in getting Aadhaar cards for your children? Need not anymore. Head to the common service centre recognised by Department of Electronics and Information Technology, Government of India at 16th Avenue, Ashok Nagar, Chennai, where it is done exclusively for children below five years from Mondays to Saturdays this month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking to ‘News Today’, H Moorthy of MGM e-Governance Services said, ”We are doing Aadhaar card enrollment for newborns to children below five years. Parents either father or mother has come to with the child. He/she has to bring Aadhaar card and childs birth certificate. The child would be photographed and the fingerprint of the parent will be taken. After three to four days, the Aadhaar number would be generated and communicated to the parents mobile number. They can download them and take a print out after paying the due amount.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He further said the biometric (fingerprint and iris) and demographic (area, address) details of children will be collected when they are between six and years old. “Later, when they attain 15 years, there would be another updation,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two operators to enroll details of the children and this will go on till this month end. “From March, we will enroll for seniors,” Moorthy said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Schools can also make use of the opportunity, where we are ready to enroll them for Aadhaar card. Around 100 children can be covered per day,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MGM e-Governance Services Centre is located at No 3, 16th Avenue, Ashok Nagar (Opposite to Velankanni Matriculation School).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Very soon, you can do “iris” Aadhaar authentication from your smartphone</title>
      <link>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/soon-can-iris-aadhaar-authentication-smartphone/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 10 May 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/soon-can-iris-aadhaar-authentication-smartphone/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cheap in-built iris scanners will eradicate use of costly ones for mass adoption of Aadhaar verification.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Delta ID Inc., a consumer-grade iris scanning technology provider for mobile phones, proposed the introduction of iris integrated mobile phones as a cost-effective way of reducing the failure rates in Aadhaar biometric authentication, as recently reported in MGNREGA tests in Telangana.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We believe iris integrated smartphones and tablets will address the issues reported with Aadhaar biometric authentication. The UIDAI and the worldwide biometric community have tested and found iris to have better reliability. We are confident the failure rates will be drastically lower once the cheaper iris integrated mobile devices are adopted in the market,” said Dr. Salil Prabhakar, President and CEO, Delta ID Inc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the government mandating the use of Aadhaar biometric authentication in more spheres of the society, the need for a biometric modality that works reliably is critical. Unlike fingerprints that are being reported to show high failure rates due to wear and tear, the iris, being a protected internal organ, is expected to be significantly more reliable. Additionally, since the iris is not affected with age, it works reliably across all age groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the key impediments in the large-scale roll out of iris for Aadhaar has been the high cost of iris devices. This is being addressed with the rollout of iris integrated mobile devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To this regard, Samsung partnered with Delta ID to launch India’s first iris integrated tablet in May 2016. The technology is arriving in smartphones too, and not only in high end devices such as Samsung Galaxy S8, but also in low cost smartphones developed by Indian manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Delta ID’s ActiveIRIS technology passed the Standardisation Testing and Quality Certification’s (STQC) FRR test with better than 99 percent accuracy, and has been certified by the STQC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Active IRIS and a combination of STQC-certified hardware components can be integrated by any mobile device to expeditiously introduce iris integrated mobile devices in the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;SBI&amp;rsquo;s virtual queuing app can be downloaded free of cost from Google Play and Apple app stores.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SBI or State Bank of India is offering a virtual queue ticket or &amp;ldquo;e-token&amp;rdquo; service through its newly-launched app No Queue, which enables customers to avail select banking services at its select branches without having to stand in queues. SBI customers &amp;ldquo;can book a virtual token&amp;hellip;and skip the queue,&amp;rdquo; India&amp;rsquo;s largest bank SBI said on Twitter. SBI&amp;rsquo;s No Queue app was launched by the bank&amp;rsquo;s chairperson Arundhati Bhattacharya in March this year. The mobile-based virtual queuing app can be downloaded free of cost from Google Play and Apple app stores. &amp;ldquo;The Application is designed to save customers&amp;rsquo; valuable time, avoid queue for Banking services and aims to provide the customers with a better customer service experience,&amp;rdquo; SBI had said in a press release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A user can select a minimum of one and maximum five services in virtual ticket using No queueapp, as per the SBI website. Here are few other things to know about the No Queue app:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;services&#34;&gt;Services&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SBI offers a variety of services under the &amp;lsquo;no queue&amp;rsquo; facility. Some of these include cheque deposit, cash deposit/withdrawal, demand draft, NEFT/RTGS and loan account opening/maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;benefits&#34;&gt;Benefits&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The No Queue app empowers those interested in SBI&amp;rsquo;s banking services to efficiently book a virtual token without being physically present in the branch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The app provides &amp;ldquo;real time status notification of your position in the queue&amp;rdquo;, as per its description on Google Play Store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Customers can generate an e-token before being physically present in the branch. This way, he or she avoids waiting in a queue and saves time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The app conveys the estimated waiting time, the number of customers ahead in the queue and the distance to the branch from the point of booking, SBI has said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Customers will be updated about their position in the queue through alerts, according to the app&amp;rsquo;s description on Play Store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;who-can-book-e-token&#34;&gt;Who can book &amp;ldquo;e-token&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Individuals - SBI and non-SBI customers - registered on the No Queue app installed on their devices can avail this facility&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;how-to-use&#34;&gt;How to use&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A user can register on the No Queue app by entering basic information such as name and mobile number to start using the app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a virtual ticket is generated through the No Queue app, the customer will receive a notification about his or her position in the queue. A button that says &amp;lsquo;Activate&amp;rsquo; will be available on the app when the customer reaches the fifth position in the queue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After reaching the branch, a customer activating the queue ticket will be &amp;ldquo;serviced immediately, thus avoiding waiting time at the Branch&amp;rdquo;, the press release added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;can-i-reschedule-my-visit&#34;&gt;Can I reschedule my visit?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After booking a virtual ticket, customers also have the facility of rescheduling or renewing the ticket in case they are running late. The rescheduling option will be available only until when the customer is within the first five positions in the queue.&lt;/p&gt;
