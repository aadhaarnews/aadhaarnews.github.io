      <description>Nandan Nilekani thinks that the infrastructure needed to enable more than a billion people to transact digitally is already in place.
The Indian economy will digitalise through mobile-based payments that are faster and cheaper to roll out, rather than cards that are more common in the West.
Is India’s economyprepared to shift from cash to a ‘less-cash’ model that the government has been talking about since demonetisation? Yes, says Nandan Nilekani, a name synonymous with Aadhaar, and now part of the Niti Aayog panel on e-payments that is working with chief ministers to promote the use of digital paymentssystems across the country.</description>
