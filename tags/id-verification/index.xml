      <description>State Bank of India (SBI) expects to collect Rs. 2,000 crore as penalty on savings bank accounts which have failed to maintain a minimum balance, a sum which may be used to partly cover the costs incurred on the linking of accounts with Aadhaar.
The recent directive of the government to link all savings bank accounts with Aadhaar by December 31 was a &amp;ldquo;very costly affair&amp;rdquo; as lenders were already facing high costs in maintaining such accounts and complying with the KYC (know your customer) requirement, says SBI Managing Director Rajnish Kumar.</description>

      <description>In a bid to make poor and illiterate in the rural areas adopt to digital payments, the government is now giving Aadhaar Pay a push as it will ensure financial transactions by just using fingerprint.
Aadhaar Pay is a merchant version of Aadhaar-enabled payment system(AEPS) and the government hopes that it will be an alternative for all online and card transactions which require password and PIN. It will facilitate merchants to take cashless payments from a customer as it will only require Aadhaar number, name of the bank (from where the money is to be deducted) and finger print for authentication.</description>

      <description>The Supreme Court says the decision to sign up for an Aadhaar card is entirely up to citizens. But the reality is that the Aadhaar card has been pushed by the Centre and the Delhi government to such an extent that it is impossible to avail services without it.
Disregarding the apex court order, the Centre over the past year has made it must for people to have an Aadhaar card to get LPG subsidy and for several other benefits and schemes.</description>

      <description>The consensus was reached after the Centre agreed to the demand of states to go in for horizontal split with regard to tax payers based on annual turnover.
In a major breakthrough, the Centre and states today reached a consensus on sharing powers for control over tax payers under GST but the new indirect tax regime will now be rolled out from July 1 instead of previously planned April 1.</description>
