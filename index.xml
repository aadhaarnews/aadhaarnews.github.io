      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung has already undertaken some early tests of the technology on its campus in South Korea, and mobile operators and vendors have announced 5G trials in countries ranging from the United States to Japan.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Communications group Arqiva and Samsung Electronics will trial Britain&amp;rsquo;s first 5G network in London this year, the companies said, with the capability of delivering ultra-fast broadband to mobile devices and potentially autonomous vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The advent of the fifth generation of mobile telecoms is viewed as essential to expected growth in demand for ever-higher speeds, capacity and reliability, with global operators such as Vodafone, Telefonica and Verizon working with network equipment makers to develop the technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arqiva, which provides TV broadcast and mobile infrastructure, said the fixed wireless access network would operate in its own 28GHz band spectrum using Samsung&amp;rsquo;s 5G base stations and equipment installed in premises in central London.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Over time, smarter network infrastructure and an enhanced ability to support exponential scale for connectivity will open the doors to further applications across a variety of markets such as IoT (Internet of Things), industrial applications and the full promise of autonomous vehicles,&amp;rdquo; Arqiva Chief Executive Simon Beresford-Wylie said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Samsung has already undertaken some early tests of the technology on its campus in South Korea, and mobile operators and vendors have announced 5G trials in countries ranging from the United States to Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arqiva, which counts the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Macquarie as investors, is considering a stock market listing and is seeking new investors, sources said this month.&lt;/p&gt;

      <link>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/airtel-offers-free-360gb-4g-data-calls-for-1-year/</link>

      <guid>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/airtel-offers-free-360gb-4g-data-calls-for-1-year/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Customers purchasing Canvas 2 device will also get 400 minutes of calling per day from Airtel to any network in India for one year with weekly limit of 1,500 minutes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Telecom major Bharti Airtel will offer one year free 4G service along with unlimited calling within its network to buyers of Micromax Canvas 2 smartphone that was been launched on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Micromax Canvas 2 will come with one year of unlimited Airtel to Airtel calling, unlimited data at no extra cost for both existing and new Airtel customers,&amp;rdquo; Shubhajit Sen, Chief Marketing Officer, Micromax told reporters here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Micromax on Thursday launched its dual SIM 4G VoLTE smartphone Canvas 2 for Rs 11,999 to foray in the device segment priced between Rs 10,000-15,000 a unit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the pact, Airtel will offer 1GB of 4G data every day and thereafter the speed will get reduced, Sen said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Customers purchasing Canvas 2 device will also get 400 minutes of calling per day to any network in India for one year with weekly limit of 1,500 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We saw huge queues in front of the Reliance (Jio) stores when they launched 3 months free offer. For 1 year, we don&amp;rsquo;t know what would be the response. After that three-month offer has become norm but for 1 year no one has seen the response,&amp;rdquo; Micromax Informatics co-founder, Rahul Sharma said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company started shipping Canvas 2 from today for sale on retail stores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;By the end of next week, it will be available across 40 -60 per cent of our market in the country. This is first phone in India with Corning Gorilla Glass 5. We will be disappointed if at least 1 million Canvas 2 are not shipped till Diwali season,&amp;rdquo; Sen said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Micromax Canvas 2 will be sold only through offline retail channel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The phone will run on Android Nougat. It comes with MediaTek quad core chipset, 3,050 mAh battery promising talk time of up to 11 hours, 3GB RAM, 16 GB internal storage and 64 GB expandable memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We will sell this phone offline only because offline buyers are looking for something more. With this phone, we are offering them 1 Year of screen replacement and 30 day smartphone replacement,&amp;rdquo; Sen said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Micromax has plans to launch around 15 smartphones within one year with focus on consumers buying smartphones in the range of Rs 10,000-15,000, Sharma said.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jio&amp;rsquo;s Prime service offers &amp;ldquo;truly free&amp;rdquo; voice, &amp;ldquo;no charge towards voice or the data used to make 4G voice calls&amp;rdquo;, according to its website.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jio is offering a variety of recharge options to members of its paid Prime service. Jio, or Reliance Jio Infocomm, the telecom arm of billionaire Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries, has also launched benefits like multi-fold data and validity under &amp;ldquo;all unlimited three months&amp;rdquo; schemes on first recharges of Rs 309 and Rs 509. Jio last week announced &amp;ldquo;all unlimited plans with special benefits&amp;rdquo; priced at Rs 309 and Rs 509, putting an end to complimentary service plans under its Summer Surprise offer on telecom regulator TRAI&amp;rsquo;s advice. Jio&amp;rsquo;s Prime service offers &amp;ldquo;truly free&amp;rdquo; voice, &amp;ldquo;no charge towards voice or the data used to make 4G voice calls&amp;rdquo;, it said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;here-s-what-you-get-under-various-jio-recharges-starting-from-rs-11&#34;&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s what you get under various Jio recharges, starting from Rs 11:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jio is offering several add-on recharges, or &amp;ldquo;boosters&amp;rdquo;, that work on the base plan&amp;rsquo;s existing validity, in case you reach the maximum 4G data limit before expiry of your active 4G plan: Rs 11, Rs 51, Rs 91, Rs 201 and Rs 301. These packs enable a Jio customer to continue using data in high speed (4G) in case he or she reaches 4G data threshold before expiry of validity on the active plan. The smallest Rs 11 recharge under this category comes with 0.1 GB of 4G data, followed by Rs 51 (1 GB), Rs 91 (2 GB), Rs 201 (5 GB) and Rs 301 (10 GB), as per the Jio website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;rs-149-recharge&#34;&gt;Rs 149 Recharge&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides free calls - local, STD and roaming - to all networks, Jio&amp;rsquo;s Rs 149 plan includes 2GB of 4G data and comes with a validity of 28 days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;rs-309-recharge&#34;&gt;Rs 309 Recharge&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jio&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;most affordable&amp;rdquo; Rs 309 recharge, which comes with the first recharge benefit - wherein Jio users making their first recharge of Rs 309 get 1GB data per day for a period of 84 days, instead of 28 days. At subsequent recharges of Rs 309, Jio users get 1GB of 4G data per day for 28 days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;rs-509-recharge&#34;&gt;Rs 509 Recharge&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jio&amp;rsquo;s this recharge pack also offers the first recharge benefit. Prime members making their first Rs 509 recharge get 2GB of 4G data per day for 84 days. The 84-day validity is reduced to 28 days on subsequent Rs 509 recharges.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Government Plans To Open Jan Aushadhi Stores At 1,000 Railway Stations</title>
      <link>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/government-plans-to-open-jan-aushadhi-stores-at-1-000-railway/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 13 May 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/government-plans-to-open-jan-aushadhi-stores-at-1-000-railway/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Plans are also on to open such outlets at bus stands in different states with an aim to take the network to small towns and villages.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plans are afoot to open Jan Aushadhi stores at around 1,000 major railway stations across India as part of drive to make quality medicines available at low cost to the public, the government said today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plans are also on to open such outlets at bus stands in different states with an aim to take the network to small towns and villages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chemicals and Fertilisers Minister Ananth Kumar said efforts are being made to ensure prescription of generic medicines by doctors for the benefit of patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I am going to speak to Railways Minister Suresh Prahbu in the coming days to open Jan Aushadhi stores (JAS) in 1,000 main railway stations in the country,&amp;rdquo; Kumar told reporters here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He further said that in order to make affordable medicines to poor people in smaller towns and villages, his ministry is looking at setting up JAS at bus stops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I am going to write to the state chief ministers and later speak to them to open JAS wherever there is a bus stand,&amp;rdquo; the minister added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said under the BJP-led government, the number of JAS has been increased to over 1,320 from 88 set up during the previous UPA regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;By the end of this year, we will have at least 3,000 JAS across India. The turnover of JAS will also touch Rs 60 crore, up from Rs 3 crore,&amp;rdquo; Kumar said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to ensure that good quality medicines are available at JAS, the minister said only those companies which comply with WHO certified good manufacturing practices will be eligible for supplies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Out of 10,000 pharmaceutical companies in India, only 1,400 are WHO GMP certified and only they will be able to participate in tender process,&amp;rdquo; Kumar added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government is also encouraging the youth to participate in opening of JAS, he said, adding that already 30,000 applications have been received which are under process for approval.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The aim is to take JAS to every block level of the country,&amp;rdquo; he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides expanding the JAS network, the minister said, the government has also expanded the basket of medicines available in the stores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Today 23 therapeutic areas are covered with 500 medicines and 150 health supplements in JAS,&amp;rdquo; Kumar said, adding that the focus is on drugs for major diseases such as heart ailments, diabetes, respiratory problems, HIV and blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When asked about making prescription of generic medicines by doctors mandatory, he said the Medical Council of India has already issued a circular to doctors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the health ministry has also asked central government hospitals to make prescription of generic drugs mandatory. All the state governments have also been sent advisories regarding the same, he added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On whether the government is bringing a legal framework for compulsory prescription of generic medicines, Kumar said at present the Drugs &amp;amp; Cosmetics Act prevents pharmacies to give equivalent of generic medicine and whatever is prescribe has to be given.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;A substitute cannot be given therefore we are going to bring in amendments in the Drugs &amp;amp; Cosmetics Act,&amp;rdquo; he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The minister said however that the government has no intention of banning branded drugs in the country saying there is also a need to encourage drug development and make business of pharmaceutical firms viable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Otherwise, we will become what we have in bulk drugs where we are a net importer, that too from only one source (China),&amp;rdquo; Kumar said.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;From India&amp;rsquo;s first private small arms manufacturing unit based at Malanpur, M.P., India, and Israel will manufacture lethal Israeli guns for the Indian armed forces and the world. This has been made possible through a joint venture between Indian defence conglomerate, Punj Lloyd, and Israel Weapon Industries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As clearly stated by Army Chief General Bipin Rawat there is a need to invest more in the military, in view of emerging security threats. And these are the guns that will add to the capabilities of the armed forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides the Israel Defence Forces, it is being used across the world, including by the US and the Special Forces of the Indian Army, Navy and IAF. This weapon was also used during the surgical strikes in POK. The Special Frontier Force (SFF), a covert special operations unit, created with the help of the CIA post the 1962 India-China war, is also using them.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>JioFiber, Reliance Jio Broadband, In These Cities</title>
      <link>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/preview-offer-of-jiofiber-reliance-jio-broadband/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jio&amp;rsquo;s prepaid and postpaid offerings have led to further competition in Indian telecom sector since the launch of its paid &amp;lsquo;Prime&amp;rsquo; services.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;HIGHLIGHTS&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jio&amp;rsquo;s upcoming broadband services being launched in some areas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JioFiber Preview Offer being tested in select Mumbai areas, among others&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reliance Jio Infocomm provides telecom services under brand Jio&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amid heightened competition in the telecom sector due to aggressive voice call and data pricing by new entrant Reliance Jio, the market is abuzz about Jio&amp;rsquo;s broadband services - JioFiber. Jio&amp;rsquo;s upcoming broadband services - called &amp;ldquo;JioFiber&amp;rdquo; - are being launched in some parts of cities like Mumbai, Delhi and Vadodara. This was said on Twitter by Jio&amp;rsquo;s official customer support- Jio Care. Jio, whose prepaid and postpaid offerings have led to further competition in Indian telecom sector since the launch of its paid &amp;lsquo;Prime&amp;rsquo; services, is testing a &amp;ldquo;JioFiber Preview Offer&amp;rdquo; in &amp;ldquo;select areas of Mumbai, Delhi-NCR, Ahmedabad, Jamnagar, Surat and Vadodara&amp;rdquo;, Jio Care said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jio&amp;rsquo;s customer care also said the company&amp;rsquo;s network is in the process of being rolled out to other cities. Jio Care was responding to a query posted by an individual on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reliance Jio Infocomm, the telecom arm of billionaire Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries, is a provider of telecom services under brand Jio. &amp;ldquo;The Company continues to make progress on the roll-out of its Fibre to the Home (FTTH) business offering with beta trials initiated in a few locations. It would expand the scope of the beta trials over the next few months,&amp;rdquo; Reliance Industries said recently while announcing earnings for the financial year ended March 31, 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, Reliance Jio has not revealed more details about the JioFiber broadband or its fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) service - which was mentioned by Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani while launching Jio operations in September last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While announcing the launch of pan-India digital services with its &amp;ldquo;Welcome Offer&amp;rdquo; in September last year, Jio had said: &amp;ldquo;In addition to fixed and wireless broadband connectivity offering superior voice and data services on an all-IP network, Jio will also offer end-to-end solutions that address the entire value chain across various digital services in key domains such as education, healthcare, security, communication, financial services, government-citizen interfaces and entertainment.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reliance Jio&amp;rsquo;s customer care team did not name any other cities where the JioFiber Preview Offer was being tested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some analysts say Jio&amp;rsquo;s aggressive pricing has intensified competition in the Indian telecom sector, forcing existing players to come up with lower tariffs. Reliance Jio is likely to gain market share from existing telecom operators, ratings agency India Ratings and Research said earlier this month, while revising its outlook on India&amp;rsquo;s telecom services sector outlook from &amp;lsquo;stable&amp;rsquo; to &amp;lsquo;negative&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jio is offering a variety of recharge options and plans to give benefits of hundreds of GBs of 4G data to its prepaid and postpaid subscribers. All schemes under Jio&amp;rsquo;s paid Prime service, which came into effect from April 1, include free voice call and roaming benefits. &amp;ldquo;Voice is truly free - no charge towards voice or the data used to make 4G voice calls,&amp;rdquo; Jio has said.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some equity funds have generated over 20 per cent CAGR return over a period of last 20 years and have helped investors accumulate a wealth of over Rs. 1 crore by investing just Rs. 5,000 per month or on a total investment of just Rs. 12 lakh.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Although, it seems unbelievable, it is a fact that some equity funds have generated over 20 per cent CAGR return over a period of last 20 years and have helped investors accumulate a wealth of over Rs. 1 crore by investing just Rs. 5,000 per month for 20 years or on a total investment of just Rs. 12 lakh. In the present scenario where bank interest rates are on a falling trend, financial planners say that equity mutual funds are one of the best instruments to accumulate long-term savings through systematic investment plan (SIP). Gains from equity mutual funds after a year are tax-free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, fund selection is one of the most difficult things to do for a retail investor as it needs lot of research. Financial planners say diversified equity funds are the best to invest through SIP for long term. Here are some funds which have generates over 20 per cent CAGR return in past 20 years:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) &lt;em&gt;HDFC Equity Fund:&lt;/em&gt; Launched on January 1, 1995, it is one of the oldest and best performing funds in India. If you had started an SIP of Rs. 5,000 in this fund on April 1, 1998, your investment would have grown to Rs. 1.95 crore by April 1, 2017, which means a CAGR return of 23.56 per cent over 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) &lt;em&gt;Reliance Growth Fund:&lt;/em&gt; This fund has generated a CAGR return of 23.68 per cent since its inception. Your Rs. 5,000 SIP in this fund, started on April 1, 1998 would have helped you accumulate a corpus of Rs. 2.12 crore by April 1, 2017 implying 17.66 times return in 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) &lt;em&gt;Franklin India Prima Fund:&lt;/em&gt; It is one of the flagship fund of Franklin Templeton India. Since its inception in December 1993, it has generated a CAGR return of 21.04 per cent till now. If you had started an SIP of Rs. 5,000 in this fund on April 1, 1998, your investment would have grown to Rs. 2.38 crore by April 1, 2017, which means a CAGR return of 25.11 per cent over 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) &lt;em&gt;Reliance Vision Fund:&lt;/em&gt; Launched on October 8, 1995, it has generated a CAGR return of 19.92 per cent till now. Your Rs. 5,000 SIP in this fund, started on April 1, 1998, would have become Rs. 1.46 crore by April 1, 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5) &lt;em&gt;HDFC Top 200 Fund:&lt;/em&gt; This flagship fund of HDFC Mutual Fund has generated a CAGR return of 20.88 per cent since its inception in September 1996. If you would have started an SIP of Rs. 5,000 in this fund on April 1, 1998, your investment would have grown to Rs. 1.43 crore by April 1, 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With falling return on bank fixed deposits, equity mutual funds are witnessing increased investment from retail investors now. Equity and equity-linked schemes have seen inflows of more than Rs. 70,000 crore in last financial year according to Association of Mutual Funds in India data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;SBI clarified on new charges on ATM and cash transactions to be effective from June 1.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;HIGHLIGHTS&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;

      <title>SBI में है आपका अकाउंट, अब इन खातों में मिनिमम बैलेंस रखने की जरूरत नहीं</title>
      <link>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/sbi-account-holders-are-now-exempt-from-keeping/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 13 May 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/sbi-account-holders-are-now-exempt-from-keeping/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;एसबीआई ने सरकारी नौकरी करने वालों को भी राहत दी है। और ऐसे अकाउंट होल्डर्स को अब न्यूनत्तम बैलेंस नहीं रखना होगा।&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;देश के सबसे बड़े सरकारी बैंक स्टेट बैंक ऑफ इंडिया (SBI) ने अपने यहां खाता रखने वाले ग्राहकों को बड़ी राहत दी है। SBI ने कई प्रकार के खातों में मिनिमम बैलेंस ना रखने पर वसूलने वाले चार्ज को हटा दिया है। अब ग्राहक इन खातों में मिनिमम बैलेंस नहीं भी रखेंगे तो उन्हें किसी भी प्रकार का शुल्क नहीं देना पड़ेगा। एसबीआई ने ट्वीट कर इस फैसले की जानकारी दी है। एसबीआई के ट्वीट के मुताबिक अब छोटी बचत खातों, बेसिक बचत खातों में मंथली एवरेज बैलेंस रखने की जरूरत नहीं है। इसके अलावा प्रधानमंत्री जन धन अकाउंट योजना के तहत खोले गये खातों में भी न्यूनत्तम बैलेंस रखने की जरूरत नहीं है। एसबीआई ने सरकारी नौकरी करने वालों को भी राहत दी है। और ऐसे अकाउंट होल्डर्स को अब न्यूनत्तम बैलेंस नहीं रखना होगा। एसबीआई ने सभी कॉरपोरेट सैलरी रखने वालों को भी ये सुविधा दी है।&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;मिनिमम बैलेंस की क्या है सीमा&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;बता दें कि SBI ने एक अप्रैल से अपने बैंकिंग नियमों में बदलाव किया है और कई तरह के खातों में मिनिमम बैलेंस ना रखने पर चार्ज लगाया है। एसबीआई का नया नियम देश के 6 मेट्रो शहरों में बचत खातों में 5 हजार रुपये रखने अनिवार्य कर दिये हैं, जबकि शहरी क्षेत्र के खाताधारकों को अपने खाते में 3 हजार रुपये रखने जरुरी होंगे, अर्ध शहरी क्षेत्र के अकाउंट होल्डर्स के लिए ये सीमा 2 हज़ार रुपये हैं, हालांकि ग्रामीण खाताधारकों को थोड़ी राहत दी गई है और उनके लिए हज़ार रुपये ही अपने खाते में रखने जरूरी किये गये हैं। एसबीआई के नये नियमों के मुताबिक ऐसा ना करने पर ग्राहक से 20 से 100 रुपये तक का जुर्माना वसूला जा सकता है।&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;कैसे करें अपने खाते की पहचान&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;बड़ा सवाल ये है कि आप इस बात की पहचान कैसे करेंगे कि आपका खाता किस कैटेगरी में आता है। एसबीआई ने स्मॉल और बेसिक सेविंग्स अकाउंट का मतलब बताते हुए लिखा है कि छोटी बचत खाते ढील दिये गये केवाईसी नियमों के तहत खोले जा सकते हैं। लेकिन इन खातों में अधिकत्तम बैलेंस और अधिकत्तम लेनदेन की सीमा तय की गई है। बेसिक सेविग्स अकाउंट केवाईसी नियमों के तहत खोला गया खाता है। बेसिक सेविंग्स खाताधारी दूसरा सेविंग अकाउंट नहीं खोल सकता है। जबकि सभी तरह के सरकारी नौकरियों में सैलरी पाने के लिए खोले गये खाते कॉरपोरेट सैलरी पैकेज के तहत आते हैं। जन-धन खातों के पासबुक में ही लिखा होता है कि ये खाते प्रधानमंत्री जन धन योजना के तहत खोले गये हैं।&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>UCO Bank Says RBI Begins Corrective Action Over High Bad Loans</title>
      <link>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/uco-bank-says-rbi-begins-corrective-action-over/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 13 May 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/uco-bank-says-rbi-begins-corrective-action-over/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Under RBI rules, prompt corrective action is triggered if a bank&amp;rsquo;s net NPL ratio crosses 6 percent.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has initiated &amp;ldquo;prompt corrective action&amp;rdquo; for state-run UCO Bank over its high bad loans and negative return on assets, UCO said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UCO, in a filing to the stock exchanges, said the action &amp;ldquo;will not have any material impact&amp;rdquo; on its performance, but did not give details of the corrective action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is the second state-run lender to come under the curbs of the Reserve Bank of India after the regulator revised the so-called prompt corrective action framework last month, tightening thresholds around bad loans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier on Friday, UCO Bank reported a narrowing of its quarterly loss and bad-loan ratio. It had net non-performing loans (NPLs) of 8.94 percent at the end of March.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under RBI rules, prompt corrective action is triggered if a bank&amp;rsquo;s net NPL ratio crosses 6 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IDBI Bank, another state-run lender, said on Tuesday it was facing corrective action by the regulator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysts say more lenders could come under central bank curbs as regulators strive to clean up bad loans of $150 billion in the sector.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>e-facility to link Aadhaar with PAN launched</title>
      <link>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/e-facility-link-aadhaar-pan-launched/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 13 May 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/e-facility-link-aadhaar-pan-launched/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I-T Department asks people to ensure that the date of birth and gender in PAN and Aadhaar are exactly the same, to ensure linkage without failure.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Income Tax Department has launched an e-facility to link Aadhaar with Permanent Account Number (PAN), a mandatory procedure for filing IT returns now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The department’s e-filing website &lt;a href=&#34;https://incometaxindiaefiling.gov.in/&#34;&gt;https://incometaxindiaefiling.gov.in/&lt;/a&gt; has created the link on its homepage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The link requires the PAN, the Aadhaar number and the “exact name as given in the Aadhaar card”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“After verification from the UIDAI [Unique Identification Authority of India], the linking will be confirmed. In case of any minor mismatch in the Aadhaar name provided, Aadhaar OTP [one time password] will be required,” the department said in an advisory to taxpayers and individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OTP would be sent on the registered mobile number and email of an individual, it said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The department urged people to ensure that the date of birth and gender in PAN and Aadhaar are exactly the same, to ensure linkage without failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There is no need to login or be registered on the e-filing website. This facility can be used by anyone to link their Aadhaar with PAN,” it said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government, under the Finance Act 2017, has made it mandatory for taxpayers to quote Aadhaar or enrolment ID of the Aadhaar application form for filing income tax returns (ITR).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, Aadhaar has been made mandatory for applying for PAN with effect from July 1, 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The department, till now, has linked over 1.18 Aadhaar with its PAN database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Aadhaar is issued by the UIDAI to a resident of India, PAN is a 10-digit alphanumeric number issued in the form of a laminated card by the IT department to any person, firm or entity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>तो क्‍या 1 जून से हर एटीएम न‍िकासी पर 25 रुपए वसूलेगा एसबीआई? दूर हुई गफलत</title>
      <link>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/sbi-account-holders-will-not-be-charged-for/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 13 May 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/sbi-account-holders-will-not-be-charged-for/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;एटीएम से पैसे निकालने के नियमों में कोई बदलाव नहीं किया गया है, और पुराने नियम ही लागू रहेंगे।&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;स्टेट बैंक ऑफ इंडिया के ग्राहकों के लिए एक जरूरी खबर है। मीडिया में चल रही खबरों के विपरीत स्टेट बैंक ऑफ इंडिया एटीएम से हर बार पैसे निकालने के लिए 25 रुपये चार्ज नहीं करेगी। स्टेट बैंक ऑफ इंडिया की बेबसाइट पर एक सर्कुलर डाला गया है, जिसके मुताबिक एक जून 2017 से एटीएम से हर बार पैसे की निकासी पर 25 रुपये चार्ज लिया जाएगा। एसबीआई के अधिकारी ने इस सर्कुलर के बारे में सफाई देते हुए कहा कि बैंक ऐसी कोई भी रकम नहीं लेने वाला है, क्योंकि ये सर्कुलर एसबीआई मोबाइल वैलेट, जिसे बड्डी भी कहा जाता है, से जुड़ा है। अंग्रेजी वेबसाइट बिजनेस टुडे के मुताबिक एसबीआई जल्द ही नया सर्कुलर जारी करने वाला है। इस&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;अधिकारी ने बताया कि एटीएम से पैसे निकालने के नियमों में कोई बदलाव नहीं किया गया है, और पुराने नियम ही लागू रहेंगे।
बता दें कि एसबीआई के इसी सर्कुलर में बताया गया है कि एक महीने में चार निकासी जिसमें की एटीएम से निकाले गये पैसे भी शामिल हैं मुफ़्त होंगे। सर्कुलर में आगे लिखा है कि अगर किसी को चार बार से ज्यादा पैसे निकालने हैं तो 50 रुपये और सर्विस टैक्स चार्ज करेगा। ये चार्ज बैंक की शाखा से पैसे निकालने के लिए
रखे गये हैं।&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;अगर कस्टमर ने दूसरे बैंक के एटीएम का इस्तेमाल किया है तो 20 रुपये और सर्विस टैक्स चार्ज किया जाएगा, और अगर एसबीआई की एटीएम से पैसे निकाले जाएंगे तो 10 रुपये और सर्विस टैक्स लिया जाएगा।
इस आदेश के मुताबिक अब चेकबुक लेने के लिए भी जेब ढीली करनी पड़ेगी। 1 जून से अगर आप 10 चेक वाला चेकबुक लेते हैं तो आपको 30 रुपये और सर्विस टैक्स देना पड़ेगा, 25 चेक वाला चेकबुक लेने पर 75 रुपये और चेकबुक देना पड़ेगा, जबकि 50 चेक वाला चेकबुक लेने पर 150 रुपये और सर्विस टैक्स भुगतान करना पड़ेगा।&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Aadhaar Card Mandatory for Joining a Company</title>
      <link>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/aadhaar-card-mandatory-joining-companys-board/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 12 May 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/aadhaar-card-mandatory-joining-companys-board/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The government has made the biometric authentication using Aadhaar mandatory after facing several scenarios of fake identity theft—including becoming a director on a board of the company or for issuing its returns by company secretaries and chartered accountants—for Companies Act-related transactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As per the sources, the Ministry Of Corporate Affairs has encountered several instances where people have established a Director Identification Number or have been chosen as directors on boards of the company without their consent, a necessity for connecting a board, as their signatures were copied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consequently, in the near future, anyone looking for a Director Identification Number will have to authenticate using biometric devices and fill up the online form that can soon be connected to PCs. In the same way, anyone chosen by the banks or government and financial institutions on boards of the company will have to provide biometric authentication. A parallel setup for company secretaries and CAs is also being operated out, confirmed the source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A squad from Infosys has been assigned with placing in the new machine that will be introduced in stages, initiating with the allocation of Director Identification Number. Progressively over a period of couple of years, it will be extended to involve all work related to MCA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will be exclusions for non-residents and others, who are not qualified to get Aadhaar such as those people whose iris or fingerprints are not able to capture. MCA considers that the projected system does not encounter any issues since the recent order of the Supreme Court on Aadhaar as the system was destined for authentication. According to sources, the Supreme court had itself recommended that mobile connections be confirmed using Aadhaar and tax department as well as the banks have also been permitted to use the distinctive identification number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From 2017, the income tax department has also made Aadhaar compulsory for issuing permanent account numbers since it targets individuals using numerous PANs, which is not legal, to avoid from taxes. Though this move was disapproved, the government thinks that employment of UID can aid in enhancing compliance across various sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How railway insurance has become a boon for many</title>
      <link>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/how-railway-insurance-has-become-a-boon-for-many/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 12 May 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/how-railway-insurance-has-become-a-boon-for-many/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When the Railway Ministry introduced an optional Indian railway travel insurance scheme for e-ticketing passengers in September 2016, the move was welcomed. But little did we know how useful the policy would become soon after. Given the recent spate of train accidents that have left many passengers injured and caused several deaths, the insurance scheme has come as a boon for many.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The policy can be bought by passengers when booking tickets online from the IRCTC website or through the mobile app. Earlier, the cost of this policy was 92 paise per passenger for an insurance cover of Rs 10 lakh in cases of demise or permanent disability. However, Dipankar Acharya, Country Head-Affinity and Strategic Relationships, Royal Sundaram General Insurance, points out, “From 10 December 2016 the cost of premium for this policy is subsidised by the railways so passengers don’t have to pay anything. Everyone should opt for this insurance policy while travelling by railways.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The policy is valid from the time of departure of train to the time of arrival of train at the destination. If an accident occurs during the journey, the injured passenger or the nominee of the deceased passenger will get the claim amount. If an insured passenger is injured, and it causes their demise within 12 months of the accident, their nominee can also claim Rs 10 lakh as per insurance policy. In case of injuries, passenger can claim hospitalisation expenses up to Rs 2 lakh which includes room rent for hospital, medicines, diagnostic test, nursing charges, ICU charges, operation theatre charges, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some of the exclusions under this policy are:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intentional self-injury, suicide or attempted suicide.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Claim in instances wherein ticket was booked by the Insured, but they did not board the train, irrespective of whether the train ticket was cancelled or not.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Claim in instances where the ticket was booked but wasn’t confirmed, but the passenger still boarded the train.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any medical treatment which was not medically necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IRCTC has tied up with three general insurance companies - ICICI Lombard, Royal Sundaram and Shriram General Insurance - for policy issuance. Once you book the tickets, you will receive the policy details on your registered mobile number and mentioned email ID. The next important step is to update the name of your nominee on the insurance company’s website before travelling. “The benefit of appointing a nominee is that it helps to settle the claim quickly in the wake of unfortunate train accidents. If a nominee is not appointed, the process of claim settlement much longer, since legal heir certificate has to be produced,” says Acharya.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make a claim, the insured or nominee must submit a report of the railway authority confirming the accident of the train, a claim form, medical reports, death or disability certificate, ID proof, and NEFT details and a cancelled cheque to the insurance company. After the submission, the claim is settled within 15 days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Easing the burden&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The insured passenger or nominee can claim the following amounts.&lt;/em&gt;
*On death: Rs 10 lakh
*On permanent total disability: Rs 10 lakh
*On permanent partial disability: Rs 7.5 lakh
*Hospitalisation expenses for injury: Rs 2 lakh
*Transportation of mortal remains: Rs 10,000&lt;/p&gt;
