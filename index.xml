      <description>Although Aadhaar is gradually gaining more importance than PAN – a ten-digit unique alphanumeric number issued by the Income Tax Department – however, PAN is still important, especially for financial transactions. According to experts, PAN is a way for the Income Tax Department to keep tabs on your financial dealings whereas Aadhaar’s main purpose is to create a centralized database of each citizen residing in India. PAN, in fact, is a very useful tool to estimate the total tax revenue being generated in the country and to be used as an identification document is not its primary job.</description>

Taking stock of the finances is an overwhelming task and it’s easy to be stumped by the maze of formalities.</description>

While the government has extended the last date for filing income tax returns to August 5 because of some technical glitches, if an assessee still misses the deadline, it does not mean that he cannot file his tax returns for the assessment year 2017-18.</description>
