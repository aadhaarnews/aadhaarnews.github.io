      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;After withdrawing the &amp;lsquo;Summer Surprise&amp;rsquo; offer, Jio has come up with Dhan Dhana Dhan&amp;rsquo; plans offering unlimited data, SMS and voice calling for three months.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;With the tariff war getting brutal in the telecom space, India&amp;rsquo;s biggest operator Airtel has come up with aggressive new prepaid plans to counter Reliance Jio&amp;rsquo;s latest &amp;lsquo;Dhan Dhana Dhan&amp;rsquo; offer. Under Rs 244 plan, Airtel is offering unlimited local and STD calls on Airtel network and 1 GB/day for 70 days. Under the Rs 399 plan, Airtel is offering free local and STD calls on any network as well as 1 GB/day data for 70 days. Under the Rs 345 plan, Airtel is offering unlimited call and 2GB data/day for 28 days. A check on Airtel&amp;rsquo;s website showed these new plans are available for subscription on prepaid numbers through online payment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After withdrawing the &amp;lsquo;Summer Surprise&amp;rsquo; offer, Jio has come up with Dhan Dhana Dhan&amp;rsquo; plans offering unlimited data, SMS and voice calling for three months. Starting Rs 309, &amp;lsquo;Jio Dhan Dhana Dhan&amp;rsquo; plan offers 1 GB data per day for a period of 84 days. Also, with a recharge of Rs 509, users will get 2 GB data per day for 84 days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reliance Jio&amp;rsquo;s aggressive entry into the telecom space has led to a drop in tariffs as the competition gets intense. The revenue of telecom sector from consumer services like mobile telephony and data dipped 10.5 per cent to Rs 37,284 crore in the October-December period over the previous three months, according to regulator Trai.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aggressive offerings from telecom operators have led higher data usage. Two out of three consumers in India want to switch to a new phone within the next 12 months, a report by Counterpoint Research said. &amp;ldquo;As per the survey, two in three users plan to upgrade to a new mobile phone in the next 12 months. This is a departure from an average of 24-30 months to under 20 months upgrade cycle,&amp;rdquo; the report said.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>8.65% Interest On Your Provident Fund Deposits To Be Credited Soon</title>
      <link>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/interest-on-your-provident-fund-deposits/</link>

      <guid>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/interest-on-your-provident-fund-deposits/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Retirement fund body EPFO has also proposed a loyalty-cum-life benefit of up to Rs. 50,000 at the time of retirement for contributing to the scheme for 20 years or more.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four crore subscribers of Employees&amp;rsquo; Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) will soon receive interest for 2016-17 on their deposits. Labour Minister Bandaru Dattatreya on Thursday said the finance ministry has agreed to a rate of interest of 8.65 per cent. &amp;ldquo;Now, the communication will come. The formal discussions are over,&amp;rdquo; the minister said. He also said: &amp;ldquo;We will immediately issue the notification and credit the rate of interest to over four crore subscribers.&amp;rdquo; The Employees&amp;rsquo; Provident Fund Organisation had earlier approved the 8.65 per cent rate on employee provident fund.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EPFO has also proposed a loyalty-cum-life benefit of up to Rs. 50,000 at the time of retirement for contributing to the scheme for 20 years or more. The benefit will also be provided in case of permanent disability even if the members have contributed for less than 20 years, the EPFO board has decided. The benefits will be available for EPFO subscribers after approval from the government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Central Board of Trustees (CBT), which is the EPFO&amp;rsquo;s apex decision-making body, has also recommended a minimum sum assured of Rs. 2.5 lakh in the event of death of a subscriber. At present, the dependants of the deceased get a sum assured of up to Rs. 6 lakh. There is no provision of minimum insurance and any benefit for surviving members or in cases of permanent disability under the scheme. The benefits will be available for EPFO subscribers after approval from the government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nearly four crore members of retirement fund body EPFO will soon be able to settle their claims like EPF withdrawal through mobile application UMANG. &amp;ldquo;The Employees&amp;rsquo; Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) is developing online claims settlement process by receiving application online,&amp;rdquo; Labour Minister Bandaru Dattatreya had said in a written reply to the Lok Sabha.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How To Check If Your Employer Has Deposited Your Income Tax</title>
      <link>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/26as-how-to-check-your-income-tax-credit/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In case there is a mismatch in TDS figures in Form 16 and Form 26AS, one should approach his/her employer or respective entity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tax return filing season has started from April 1. Usually, for many salaried employees, the first thing that comes to mind is Form 16 that is issued by employers. But another document - Form 26AS - is also a crucial document that a salaried individual should access before filing tax returns. Form 16 is a document from your employer, certifying that TDS or tax deducted at source has been deducted on your salary. Form 26AS is basically your tax credit statement which shows all taxes received by the Income Tax Department. You can access Form 26AS from the tax department&amp;rsquo;s website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It is extremely important to go through the Form 26AS to ensure that all due credits for TDS deducted from a person&amp;rsquo;s salary, FD interest, etc. are duly accounted for,&amp;rdquo; said Sandeep Sehgal, director of tax and regulatory at Ashok Maheshwary &amp;amp; Associates LLP. &amp;ldquo;Any shortfall of TDS reflected in Form 26AS than what is actually claimable in the income tax return will result in automatic generation of demand by Centralized Processing Centre of Income Tax Department subsequent to filing of income tax return.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conversely, it could also be problematic for the tax payer when excess TDS is reflected in Form 26AS. &amp;ldquo;Income Tax Department may question the person for the corresponding income which the person may not have shown in his/her income tax return. Hence, to avoid such hassles, it is necessary to tally the due TDS credit with Form 26AS,&amp;rdquo; adds Mr Sehgal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case there is a mismatch in TDS figures in Form 16 and Form 26AS, Mr Sehgal says the &amp;ldquo;person should approach the his/her employer or respective entity which has deducted TDS on any of his income and tell them to get their TDS return rectified to adjust.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The taxpayer can also see the refund received by him/her for previous assessment year in Form 26AS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;how-to-access-your-form-26as&#34;&gt;How to access your Form 26AS&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visit the income tax department&amp;rsquo;s website for tax filing (incometaxindiaefiling.gov.in) and log into your account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go to &amp;lsquo;My Account&amp;rsquo; tab and select Form 26AS from the drop down menu; After confirmation, the taxpayer will be directed to TDS Reconciliation Analysis and Correction Enabling System (TRACES) website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The taxpayer can then select the assessment year and format in which he/she would like to view Form 26AS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Password for Form 26AS PDF/text file is Date of Birth as printed on PAN card. Enter date in ddmmyyyy format to open file (e.g., for 10-Oct-2012, enter as 10102012).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taxpayers can also view Form 26AS through net banking facility. Select banks offer this facility.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Income Tax Declaration To Your Employer: The Changes You Should Be Aware Of</title>
      <link>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/income-tax-declaration-to-your-employer-the-changes/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 21 Apr 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/income-tax-declaration-to-your-employer-the-changes/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the beginning of every fiscal year, employees are asked for details like their investment in ELSS, insurance policies, house rent, home loan, education loan etc. by their employer to arrive at the annual tax liability of an employee.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the beginning of every fiscal year, employees are asked for details like their investment in ELSS (Equity Linked Savings Schemes), insurance policies, house rent, home loan, education loan etc. by their employer to arrive at the annual tax liability of an employee. This annual exercise also helps you do tax planning for the year. Based on the declaration, your employer calculates TDS or tax deducted at source. The employer will deduct tax from salary and deposit it with the tax authorities. Starting April 1, 2017, some income tax laws have changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are changes in tax laws you should be aware before submitting tax declaration:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) The tax rate on income between Rs. 2.5 lakh and Rs. 5 lakh has been halved to 5 per cent from 10 per cent. However, rebate under Section 87A gets reduced from Rs. 5,000 to Rs. 2,500. And no rebate will be applicable for taxpayers having income above Rs. 3.5 lakh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) A 10 per cent surcharge will be applicable for individuals having income ranging from Rs. 50 lakh to Rs. 1 crore (existing surcharge of 15 per cent will remain the same for individuals having income above Rs. 1 crore). However, those with taxable income of above Rs 50 lakh get the benefit of marginal relief. The concept of marginal relief is designed to provide some relief in levy of surcharge to a taxpayer where the total taxable income marginally exceeds Rs. 50 lakh or Rs. 1 crore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) No deduction will be allowed for investment in Rajiv Gandhi Equity Saving Scheme, which has been scrapped this year. This tax-saving scheme was designed exclusively for the first-time individual investors in the securities market with gross total income below a certain limit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) The government has cut down tax benefits borrowers enjoyed on properties, other than self-occupied. For properties rented out, a borrower could deduct the entire interest paid on home loan after adjusting for the rental income. On the other hand, borrowers of self-occupied properties get a deduction of Rs. 2 lakh on interest repayment on home loan. But from this year, the borrower can only claim a deduction of up to Rs. 2 lakh per year after adjusting for the rental income.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5) And the amount above Rs. 2 lakh can be carried forward for eight assessment years. Since the interest component of home loan repaid in initial years is higher, experts say that the borrower may not be able to fully adjust the interest paid as deduction even in subsequent years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6) Individuals are required to deduct a 5 per cent TDS (tax deducted at source) for house rent payments above Rs. 50,000 per month. Tax experts say that the move will ensure that persons who get a large rental income come into the tax net. It will be effective from June 1, 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7) The holding period of a property for qualifying as long-term capital gains has been reduced to two years, from three years. This will help save tax if a property is sold after two years of buying. If a property is sold before two years, the profit from the transaction will be treated as short-term capital gains and will be taxed according to the slab rate applicable to him/her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8) Along with the reduction in the holding period to two years, the base year for calculating indexation of cost has also been changed. The base year has been shifted from 1981 to 2001.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;9) Income tax officials can reopen tax cases for up to 10 years if search operations reveal undisclosed income and assets of over Rs. 50 lakh. Currently, tax officers can go back up to six years to scrutinise the books of accounts of assessees. Taxpayers who do not file their returns on time will have to shell out a penalty of up to Rs. 10,000 from Assessment Year 2018-19. However, if the total income of the person does not exceed Rs. 5 lakh, the fee payable under this section shall not exceed Rs. 1,000. The government has also made it compulsory for people to quote their Aadhaar details in their tax returns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;10) Under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban) for middle-income groups, home loan borrowers buying their first home are eligible for subsidy on interest repayments. Home loans sanctioned or applications are under consideration since January 1, 2017, are eligible for interest subsidy under the Credit Linked Subsidy Scheme for Middle Income Groups. The beneficiary earlier should not have own a house in his/her name.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In a bid to make Aadhaar Card the single identity proof, the government has made all efforts to make sure that the Aadhaar number is linked to bank accounts and tax payments.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nobody likes when their important documents are lost or misplaced. One such crucial document is the Aadhaar Card as the 12-digit unique identity number has become a matter of necessity for various purposes. The Narendra Modi government is completely committed to making Aadhaar the most potent identification instrument for Indian citizen. In a bid to make Aadhaar Card the single identity proof, the government has made all efforts to make sure that the Aadhaar number is linked to bank accounts and tax payments. Today, the Aadhaar card has become one of the vital documents to live in India, it has become a basic necessity and its need is increasing with each passing day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any person can apply for a duplicate Aadhaar card if he/she has lost or misplaced it. In case you do not know or are unsure of your Aadhaar number, or if you have lost or misplaced your acknowledgement slip that you acquired at the time of registration, then you can download a duplicate copy of your Aadhaar card by visiting the UIDAI’s website www.uidai.gov.in . The UIDAI has made it possible for all residents to acquire a duplicate card through a simple procedure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Follow the following steps to get a duplicate Aadhaar card if have misplaced your Aadhaar card&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://aadhaarcardnews.in/images/uid-1.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First, go to &lt;a href=&#34;https://resident.uidai.net.in/find-uid-eid&#34;&gt;https://resident.uidai.net.in/find-uid-eid&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Enter your full name, your email address and your registered Mobile Number&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enter the security code as displayed and click on “Get OTP” button&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Jio At Top Spot In 4G Download Speed In March, Says Telecom Regulator&#39;s Report</title>
      <link>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/jio-at-top-spot-in-4g-download-speed-in-march-says-telecom/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 21 Apr 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/jio-at-top-spot-in-4g-download-speed-in-march-says-telecom/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Average download speed on Reliance Jio network was 16.48 megabit per second (mbps) in March against 8.33 mbps on Idea Cellular.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New telecom operator Reliance Jio&amp;rsquo;s average download speed at 16.48 mbps was almost double of its rivals Idea Cellular and Bharti Airtel&amp;rsquo;s in March, a report by telecom regulator Trai has showed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Average download speed on Reliance Jio network was 16.48 megabit per second (mbps) in March against 8.33 mbps on Idea Cellular&amp;rsquo;s and 7.66 mbps on Bharti Airtel&amp;rsquo;s network, the monthly report by Trai showed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Theoretically, a user can download one Bollywood movie in about 5 minutes at 16 mbps speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vodafone registered average download speed of 5.66 mbps, Reliance Communications 2.64 mbps, Tata Docomo 2.52 mbps, state run BSNL 2.26 mbps and Aircel 2.01 mbps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trai collects and computes data download speed with the help of its MySpeed application on real-time basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, a survey on mobile network speed covering two metros of Delhi and Mumbai, and two states of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu by a private firm Open Signal has claimed that Bharti Airtel had the fastest network with average 4G download speed of 11.5 mbps while Reliance Jio was fourth with 3.92 mbps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The survey claimed to have collected information from 1.3 billion datapoints covering 93,464 users during the period between December 2016 and February 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The findings reveal that Airtel didn&amp;rsquo;t just win OpenSignal&amp;rsquo;s 4G speed award, it wound up on top of 3G and overall rankings as well. OpenSignal measured Airtel&amp;rsquo;s average LTE download speed at 11.5 mbps, which was 3 mbps faster than the results measured on its nearest rivals Vodafone and Idea,&amp;rdquo; OpenSignal said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new survey has come amid ongoing tussle between Airtel and Reliance Jio over claims of India&amp;rsquo;s fastest mobile network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reliance Jio has challenged Airtel&amp;rsquo;s advertisement campaign&lt;/em&gt; in which the telecom major claimed to be &amp;ldquo;officially&amp;rdquo; fastest network in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI) found the ad claiming Airtel to be &amp;ldquo;officially&amp;rdquo; fastest network as misleading and asked the company to modify or withdraw the commercial by April 11 to which the company complied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Airtel has filed appeal before ASCI for review of the decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Open Signal report said that Vodafone was at the second spot with average 4G download speed of 8.59 mbps followed by Idea Cellular with 8.34 mbps and Jio on 4th spot with 3.92 mbps speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report ranks Jio on top for widest availability of 4G network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;OpenSignal&amp;rsquo;s testers on Jio&amp;rsquo;s network were able to find a 4G signal 91.6 per cent of the time, an exceptional availability measurement by any global standard. In comparison, no other Indian operator scored higher than 60 per cent in its 4G availability tests,&amp;rdquo; the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mr Sinha disclosed this at the 11th edition of the Mindmine Summit organised by the Mindmine Institute, an independent think-tank set up by Hero Enterprise.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Union Minister Jayant Sinha on Thursday said Prime Minister Narendra Modi will launch the government&amp;rsquo;s air regional connectivity scheme - UDAN - on April 27. Mr Sinha disclosed this at the 11th edition of the Mindmine Summit organised by the Mindmine Institute, an independent think-tank set up by Hero Enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The aviation industry in India is a sunrise sector. We are working towards UDAN or &amp;lsquo;Ude Desh ka har Nagarik&amp;rsquo;, building efficient regional air connectivity, between the metros and the tier 3 and 4 cities like Shimla, Gorakhpur, Kanpur,&amp;rdquo; Mr Sinha said while addressing a session on &amp;lsquo;India in 2017: More Roadbumps or Achhe Din?&amp;rsquo; at the summit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;PM, Shri Modi will launch UDAN on 27th April and we will add 33 new airports across the small Indian cities in one year. This will be achieved with a subsidy of only Rs. 205 crore.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PM Modi is expected to launch the scheme at Jubbarhatti, located on the outskirts of Shimla on April 27.&lt;/p&gt;

      <link>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/pradhan-mantri-jan-dhan-yojana-from-zero-balance/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 21 Apr 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The government&amp;rsquo;s financial inclusion scheme PMJDY or &amp;lsquo;Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana&amp;rsquo; offers easy access to banking services. The Jan-Dhan Yojana was launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on August 28, 2014. As on April 5, 2017, 28.23 crore accounts have been opened. This was stated in a tweet by the Finance Ministry on Twitter. A bank account under PMJDY can be opened by visiting any bank branch or business correspondent outlet, or &amp;ldquo;Bank Mitr&amp;rdquo;, and used thereafter for various social security schemes. The Jan Dhan tally, the ministry added, has reached Rs 63,971 crore in deposits and 22.14 crore Rupay cards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana seeks to ensure access to financial services - banking/savings and deposit accounts, remittance, credit, insurance and pension - in an affordable manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jan Dhan accounts are opened with zero balance. For those who want to get a cheque book will have to fulfil the minimum balance criteria of the respective bank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those who want to open an account under the PMJDY scheme will need a few documents. Those who don&amp;rsquo;t have all the documents can open Small Accounts with banks, the Reserve Bank of India has said. Small Accounts - valid normally for a period of twelve months - have certain limits related to aggregate credits, aggregate withdrawals and balance. (Know more)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Basic Savings Bank Deposit Account or BSBDA, as per the RBI, includes services such as deposit and withdrawal of cash at bank branch as well as ATMs and receipt/credit of money through electronic payment channels or by means of collection/deposit of cheques. (Also read: At SBI, no need to maintain minimum balance in these accounts)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Benefits being offered under the Jan Dhan accounts include interest on deposits, accidental insurance cover (Rs 1 lakh) and life cover (Rs. 30,000) subject to fulfilment of eligibility. They also provide access to pension and insurance products&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interest rate applicable for Saving Bank Accounts (presently at 4 per cent in most of the banks) will be admissible to accounts opened under PMJDY scheme, as per the State Bank of India website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides, a Jan Dhan account can also be used to receive Direct Benefit Transfer - under which the government transfers subsidies directly to the people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An overdraft facility will be permitted after satisfactory operation for six months. An overdraft up to Rs 5000 is offered by the government in only one account per household &amp;ldquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rupay Debit Card, a domestic debit card introduced by National Payment Corporation of India, is accepted at all ATMs (for cash withdrawal) and at most of the PoS or point-of-sale machines in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government aims to achieve a comprehensive financial inclusion by August 14, 2018 in two phases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>School kids to lend Aadhaar details during re-admission</title>
      <link>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/school-kids-lend-aadhaar-details-re-admission/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Based on directives from the central government, the directorate of education(DoE) has asked schools under its purview to record the Aadhaar card numbers of its students. Director of education G P Bhat said that the idea was to “arrest any duplication of benefits of central government schemes extended to students”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“School children receive benefit from several central government schemes like midday meals, free raincoats and notebooks, incentives to girl students, etc,” Bhat said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DoE has issued a circular to schools asking them to inform students of the need to submit their Aadhaar card numbers when declaring the annual results for the current academic year, so that students bring with them the necessary details while seeking readmission in the higher class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The move, aimed at ‘improving efficiency and transparency’, comes following a push from the central government to link the Aadhaar number with subsidy schemes related to school education. The department of school education and literacy (DSEL), under the human resource development ministry, has decided to give a window until June 30 to those who do not have an Aadhaar card yet.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Aadhaar Card Mandatory For Subsidy: Indian Government</title>
      <link>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/aadhaar-card-mandatory-subsidy-indian-government/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In a bid to curb corruption in the Public Distribution System (PDS), the Indian government had made the Aadhar Card mandatory for availing foodgrain subsidy at PDS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government has already made Aadhar Card mandatory for the cooking gas LPG subsidy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government has declared Rs 1.4 lakh crore subsidy under the food security law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A timeline till June 30 is given for the common people who avail subsidy to apply for Aadhar Card, the government categorically stated in the notification in this regard that no subsidised foodgrains with Aadhaar after June 30.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since November 2016, the Government of India, under the National Food Security Law (NFSA), has been providing 5 kg of foodgrains per person per month at Rs 1-3/kg to over 80 crore people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The notification has been applicable from February 8 in all States and Union Territories (UTs) except Assam, Meghalaya and Jammu and Kashmir. This move indicates Government’s serious intetion of digitisation to curb the corruption in PDS as well as a move towards a simplifies delivery process.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Aadhaar cards to be linked with university degrees, certificates</title>
      <link>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/aadhaar-cards-to-be-linked-with-university-degrees-certificates/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 20 Apr 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/aadhaar-cards-to-be-linked-with-university-degrees-certificates/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The proposal is currently under consideration by the &lt;em&gt;ministry of human resource development (MHRD)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an attempt to prevent forgery of university degrees and certificates in future, the University Grants Commission (UGC) is planning to link the Aadhaar card number and print the student’s photograph on the degree/certificate from next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposal is currently under consideration by the ministry of human resource development (MHRD). If the proposal gets approved, the commission would issue directions to the universities and educational institutions for the same by next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“After receiving fraud degree-related complaints, the MHRD had sought suggestions from the UGC to tackle this issue. So, in the beginning of this month, the commission suggested a proposal of printing the Aadhaar card number and photograph of the student mandatorily on the degrees,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As per the proposal, having an Aadhar card number will not only prevent forgery, but will also make it easier to store the degrees in a digital format in the National Academic Depositary (NAD).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The students will then just have to mention their Aadhaar card number, after which they will be able to access the degree/certificate from anywhere. If the experiment is successful for the universities, then the same will be implemented for Class 10 and 12,” the source added.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Aadhaar eKYC mandatory for mobile connections: Here’s how it applies to you</title>
      <link>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/aadhaar-ekyc-mandatory-mobile-connections-heres-applies/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 20 Apr 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/aadhaar-ekyc-mandatory-mobile-connections-heres-applies/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you don’t have an Aadhaar card number, you’ll probably have to get one soon, since the government is making this mandatory across a range of services, and it looks like getting a mobile connection is next on the list. Last Friday, Department of Telecom (DoT) has issued an order asking telecom operators to start the process of re-verifying their subscribers with Aadhaar-based eKYC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DoT’s order reads, “All licensees shall re-verify all existing mobile subscribers (prepaid and postpaid) through Aadhaar-based e-KYC process.”  For telecom providers, the DoT is giving a one year time period to carry out this eKYC process; the order puts the final date at February 6, 2018. The DoT directive comes after the Supreme Court issued an order with this respect in February this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what is Aadhaar-based eKYC and what does it require? For starters, the Aadhaar card becomes mandatory if you to hold onto your old mobile number or even get a new one. Aadhaar eKYC is a paperless form of Know Your Customer (KYC); the KYC guidelines ensure that the service provider, and this is not just restricted to mobile service providers, but includes banks, etc, need to have details of their customers like address, age, full name, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Aadhaar-based KYC  identity, address and other details are verified via the Aadhaar authentication online. A user will have to give his Aadhaar number, do the biometric verification, and the KYC is done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how will you know when to get eKYC done with your mobile operator? No need to rush just yet, but this will come soon. Customers will start receiving SMS alerts, or see television and print ads from their telecom provider regarding the same as DoT has directed them to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cellular operators’ association of India (COAI) had said that its members, which includes the majority of telecom providers in the country, will meet later this week to discuss the process. However COAI has pointed out the entire exercise will cost Rs 1,000 crore for infrastructure and training, which will have to be borne by the operators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The issue of fake subscribers will go away. We will try our best to cover the entire base within the stipulated time frame of one year but in case we cannot, we may ask DoT for an extension,” COAI Director General Rajan Mathews said in a statement to PTI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will one eKYC be good enough to get another connection with the same operator? No, if you go by the DoT notification. According to a PTI report, “For issuing additional mobile connections to re-verified subscriber, the operator would have to follow a separate eKYC process.” So if you have a Vodafone or Airtel connection, and you get it re-verified, getting a second number will require another eKYC, which is tedious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if you are converting prepaid to postpaid or vice versa, then you won’t be requiring another eKYC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons for Aadhaar-based eKYC is that it will help deal with the issue of fake mobile subscribers in the country. But the catch is that it also means that anyone who doesn’t have an Aadhaar card won’t be able to continue with the mobile connection, which sounds extreme. India has over 1 billion plus mobile connections, and this Aadhaar eKYC will impact every single user.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Aadhaar may be made mandatory for all 84 DBT schemes: Report</title>
      <link>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/aadhaar-may-made-mandatory-84-dbt-schemes-report/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 20 Apr 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/aadhaar-may-made-mandatory-84-dbt-schemes-report/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;So far, furnishing the Aadhaar card has been made mandatory by the government for nearly 34-35 central schemes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furnishing the Aadhaar card has now been made mandatory by the government for nearly 34-35 central schemes, whether it is investing in the employee provident fund (EPF) or availing mid-day meals in schools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to a report in the Economic Times today, this could soon extend to all 84 schemes so far under the Direct subsidy Benefit Transfer scheme. The 12 digit unique-identity number issued to Indian residents based on their biometric and demographic data, has helped the exchequer save nearly Rs 49,000 crore over the last couple of years in DBT under various schemes including LPG subsidy and helped more than 4.47 crore people open bank accounts through e-KYC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the other schemes that are now covered under the mandatory Aadhaar are Sarv Shiksha Abhiyan meant to make elementary education universal, skill training programmes National Social Assistance Programme and Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana, National Action Plan for skill training of disabled and for disabled persons seeking aids and appliances, Swadhar Greh Scheme for rehabilitation of sexually exploited women, and LPG and foodgrains under the public distribution system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aadhaar will also be required of NGOs seeking assistance for working on welfare of SCs, backward castes, alcoholics and old people. Residents who are yet to get their Aadhaar card made can do so until June 30. Enrolment facility will be made available by the department at convenient locations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For anyone wanting to avail benefits while Aadhaar is still under process, the enrolment slip can be used along with any one of the nine prescribed identity proof documents. However, according to a source, notifications from the department on the use of Aadhaar clearly states, “no person will be denied any benefit for want of Aadhaar if he needs the benefit in a time-bound manner or as an emergency measure”.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Aadhaar not compulsory for obtaining marriage certificate: CIC to Govt</title>
      <link>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/aadhaar-not-compulsory-obtaining-marriage-certificate-cic-govt/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 20 Apr 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/aadhaar-not-compulsory-obtaining-marriage-certificate-cic-govt/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;The Chief Information Commission has asked the government and marriage registration authorities to raise awareness and provide publicity through various media that Aadhaar is not compulsory for the purpose of marriage registration scheme, reports LiveLaw.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The commission ruled that the compulsory registration of marriages helps tackle various issues like child marriage, marriage without consent, bigamous marriages, etc., and as such, the government should make it easier and more convenient to facilitate the registration, by not requiring other documents like Aadhaar and making changes for online application for marriage under the Special Marriage Act etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CIC cited Supreme Court’s order from 2014, which ruled that the government should not restrict social benefits to those who are yet to receive their Aadhaar card. Last year, the SC had also said that the card scheme is purely voluntary and cannot be made mandatory for scholarships. However, contrary to its prior stance, the SC asked the Government to link all mobile numbers with Aadhaar card details within a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;centre-s-push-to-increase-aadhaar-saturation&#34;&gt;Centre’s push to increase Aadhaar saturation?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The usage of Aadhaar as a verification system has been on the rise where multiple services including the IIT JEE, employee provident funds, PDS food grain purchases, RTE admissions and Jharkhand’s food and public distribution systems also using it. Private companies have also started using Aadhaar for verification purposes, such as iris scans by DCB Bank for eKYC, Microsoft’s Skype Lite which supports Aadhaar based verification, etc. However, use of Aadhaar by making it compulsory to avail some services, has come under heavy criticism for not respecting user privacy or being very secure.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>After Notes Ban, 18 Lakh Cases Of Income, Bank Account Mismatches Detected: Arun Jaitley</title>
      <link>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/after-notes-ban-18-lakh-cases-of-income-bank/</link>

      <guid>http://aadhaarcardnews.in/after-notes-ban-18-lakh-cases-of-income-bank/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Government authorities have detected 18 lakh cases after demonetisation where the income profiles of people do not match their account profile, the Lok Sabha was informed today. Preliminary information has been sought from such people and many have responded. Those who have not given details would be issued with notices as per procedure, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said during Question Hour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Responding to supplementaries, he said there was an extended footprint of digitisation in the banking sector. With digitisation, the risk of tampering of technology also increases. But banks are also hiring experts to develop firewalls around their system to make it increasingly difficult to breach it, Jaitley said, adding that technology has to keep pace with crime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He also said that risk assessment was a continuous process for banks who do it individually and collectively. In his written response, Jaitley said as on March 31, 2016, 29 per cent of the savings accounts of public sector banks and regional rural banks sponsored by them were inoperative or lying dormant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A variety of factors have a bearing on an account being inoperative. These may include factors like opening of a new account with change of residence or office, death of the account holder or the relative convenience of operating different accounts, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
